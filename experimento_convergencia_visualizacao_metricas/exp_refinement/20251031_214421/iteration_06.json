  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories and are at transitional points in life, such as career changes, personal losses, or significant life decisions, which influence their interactions and decisions.\n- Settings are specific and integral to the story, often involving unique or meaningful locations like art galleries, bookstores, or specific cities, which enhance the emotional resonance and thematic depth.\n- Plots revolve around nuanced, internal conflicts rather than external obstacles, focusing on the characters' emotional journeys and the tension between desire and reality, often leading to a bittersweet or unresolved conclusion.\n- Emotional arcs are characterized by a tone of nostalgia and longing, with themes of connection, missed opportunities, and the complexity of human relationships, often culminating in a poignant, open-ended resolution.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke atmosphere and emotion, with dialogue that is natural and reveals character depth, often leaving much unsaid to maintain subtlety and tension.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE minimal character backstories (e.g., 'PR partner' or 'architecture student') WITH detailed backstories with specific roles (e.g., 'twice-divorced PR partner' or 'architecture student restoring a historic greenhouse')\n- REPLACE objects as primary metaphors (e.g., vinyl records, napkin blueprints) WITH emotional and physical intimacy as metaphors (e.g., 'his hands in her hair, her teeth at his shoulder')\n- ADD: scenes of shared routines or rituals (e.g., 'midnight walks, coffee on library steps') to deepen connection before separation\n- REPLACE ambiguous endings (e.g., 'the notes dissolving into city noise') WITH explicit but bittersweet closures (e.g., 'They choose one last tender night, say I love you, and let the words hang')\n- ADD: dialogue that reveals unspoken tensions (e.g., 'She asks if marriage is imaginable; he isn’t sure he trusts himself to try')\n- KEEP: bittersweet endings without forced resolution\n- ADD: specific geographic and cultural details (e.g., 'Ansley Park home, Barolo and almond cake') to ground the story in a tangible world",

    "**\"The Last Night at the Blue Heron\"**  \nIn a coastal Maine town known for its seasonal disappearances, a divorced marine biologist and a nomadic folk musician meet at a failing bar called the Blue Heron. She’s cataloging endangered shorebirds; he’s playing his last gig before leaving for Nashville. Over whiskey and shared silence, they bond over their mutual fear of staying—and their inability to leave together. Their ritual: midnight walks along the pier, counting stars instead of making promises. When he finally asks her to come with him, she hesitates, her hands still smelling of saltwater and ink. They share one last kiss, her teeth grazing his shoulder, before she stays and he goes. The bar closes the next day.",
    "**\"Ansley Park, 2 AM\"**  \nA twice-widowed historian restoring a pre-war home in Atlanta hires a jazz pianist with a gambling debt to help archive her late husband’s vinyl collection. Their routine: espresso at midnight, arguing over Coltrane versus Ellington. She loves the cracks in the records; he hears only the gaps between notes. One night, after he confesses he’s leaving to pay off his debts in Macau, she traces the scars on his knuckles and asks, “What if you stayed?” He doesn’t answer. They make love in the empty parlor, the needle stuck on a skipping refrain.",
    "**\"The Greenhouse Effect\"**  \nAn architecture student rebuilding a hurricane-damaged greenhouse in New Orleans crosses paths with a chef who visits daily to sketch heirloom tomatoes. He’s obsessed with imperfect symmetry; she cooks only what’s about to rot. Their ritual: sharing Barolo and almond cake on the fractured glass roof, her foot hooked around his ankle. When she gets a job in Copenhagen, he helps her pack but refuses to see her off at the airport. “I don’t do goodbyes,” he says, handing her a blueprint of the greenhouse—folded into a napkin boat. She leaves it on the terminal bench.",
    "**\"The Budapest Metro\"**  \nA disillusioned diplomat and a translator with aphantasia (she can’t visualize memories) keep meeting on the same metro line in Budapest. He’s negotiating his divorce; she’s fleeing a failed novel. Their ritual: trading lies about their pasts at the Keleti station, where the trains never leave on time. One night, she presses his palm to her cheek and says, “Describe me so I’ll remember.” He whispers, “Like someone I shouldn’t have let go.” They part at the escalator, her scarf snagging on his watch.",
    "**\"The Librarian’s Latitude\"**  \nIn a fading library on the Oregon coast, a cartographer-turned-librarian and a poet with a tremor in her hands bond over misaligned maps and coffee stains. She’s losing her ability to write; he’s obsessed with places he’ll never visit. Their ritual: tracing imaginary routes on each other’s skin. When she receives a grant to study in Morocco, he gifts her a globe with all the coordinates scratched out except one. She kisses him—a closed-mouth, salt-edged thing—and leaves the globe behind on the circulation desk."
