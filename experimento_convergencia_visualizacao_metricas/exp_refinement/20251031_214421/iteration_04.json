  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories and are at transitional points in life, such as career changes, personal losses, or significant life decisions, which influence their interactions and decisions.\n- Settings are specific and integral to the story, often involving unique or meaningful locations like art galleries, bookstores, or specific cities, which enhance the emotional resonance and thematic depth.\n- Plots revolve around nuanced, internal conflicts rather than external obstacles, focusing on the characters' emotional journeys and the tension between desire and reality, often leading to a bittersweet or unresolved conclusion.\n- Emotional arcs are characterized by a tone of nostalgia and longing, with themes of connection, missed opportunities, and the complexity of human relationships, often culminating in a poignant, open-ended resolution.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke atmosphere and emotion, with dialogue that is natural and reveals character depth, often leaving much unsaid to maintain subtlety and tension.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE gimmicky meet-cutes (e.g., cookbook, clock repair, ferryman) WITH organic connections rooted in shared emotional histories (e.g., ex-lovers at a concert, coworkers proofreading memoirs)\n- REPLACE vague professions (e.g., travel writer, ferryman’s daughter) WITH specific careers with thematic relevance (e.g., healthcare-tech CFO, architecture student, PR partner)\n- REPLACE epistolary devices as primary connection (e.g., margin notes, unsent letters) WITH physical intimacy and shared routines (e.g., long walks, rooftop rituals, unhurried touch)\n- ADD: geographic specificity anchoring relationships (e.g., Ansley Park homes, Buckhead galas, Seville cafés)\n- ADD: textured dialogue revealing unspoken tensions (e.g., 'We were almost something once' vs. 'Tell me you’ll miss this')\n- KEEP: bittersweet endings where characters consciously choose separation\n- KEEP: sensory details that deepen emotional resonance (e.g., almond cake, vinyl records, winter light)",

    "**\"The Last Proofread\"**  \nA PR partner and an architecture student meet weekly at a Seville café to proofread each other’s work—her corporate reports, his thesis on forgotten spaces. Over almond cake and bitter coffee, they dissect sentences and skirt around their attraction. One afternoon, he traces a blueprint of her hand on a napkin; she pretends not to notice. When he accepts a job in Oslo, they spend a final hour editing his farewell letter to her, striking out every sentimental line. The story ends with her folding the napkin into her wallet, the ink blurred by rain as she walks away.",
    "**\"Winter Light in Ansley Park\"**  \nTwo ex-lovers, now a healthcare-tech CFO and a divorced music teacher, reunite at a Buckhead gala. They slip outside to a frozen garden, where he confesses he’s selling their old Ansley Park home. She laughs, recalling how they’d argued over paint colors, then quiets when he says, “I kept the yellow bedroom.” Their dialogue lingers on vinyl records they’d left behind—unplayed, unresolved. They part without exchanging numbers, the winter light thinning between them.",
    "**\"Rooftop Rules\"**  \nIn Barcelona, a flamenco guitarist and a climate journalist share a rooftop ritual: smoking, staring at the Sagrada Família, and never mentioning his upcoming move to Jakarta. Their intimacy lives in unhurried touches—her fingers brushing his wrist when passing a lighter, his knee against hers during storms. One night, she breaks the rules: “Tell me you’ll miss this.” He exhales smoke instead of answering. The story closes with her playing a chord progression he’ll never hear finished, the notes dissolving into city noise.",
    "**\"The Archivists\"**  \nTwo coworkers at a decaying Savannah museum—a conservator with a tremor in her hands and a historian hiding his failed novel—bond over restoring a vandalized portrait. They spend weeks piecing together the face of a forgotten bride, their shoulders touching in the basement lab. When the museum closes, he gifts her a page from his manuscript; she uses it to wrap the bride’s broken frame. The final image: her reading his words under a flickering bulb, both knowing she’ll never turn the page.",
    "**\"Ferry Street\"**  \nIn Philadelphia, a sous-chef and a hospice nurse meet at a diner after her night shifts, his dawn prep work. They trade stories of other people’s endings—his food critic’s last review, her patient’s final request for cherry pie. One morning, she brings a vinyl record (“For the diner’s jukebox,” she lies). He doesn’t admit he’s quitting to follow his ex to Portland. The last scene: him sliding the record into his bag, her watching through the diner window as sunrise turns the grease-streaked glass gold."
