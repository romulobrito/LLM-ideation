  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories and are at transitional points in life, such as career changes, personal losses, or significant life decisions, which influence their interactions and decisions.\n- Settings are specific and integral to the story, often involving unique or meaningful locations like art galleries, bookstores, or specific cities, which enhance the emotional resonance and thematic depth.\n- Plots revolve around nuanced, internal conflicts rather than external obstacles, focusing on the characters' emotional journeys and the tension between desire and reality, often leading to a bittersweet or unresolved conclusion.\n- Emotional arcs are characterized by a tone of nostalgia and longing, with themes of connection, missed opportunities, and the complexity of human relationships, often culminating in a poignant, open-ended resolution.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke atmosphere and emotion, with dialogue that is natural and reveals character depth, often leaving much unsaid to maintain subtlety and tension.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE archetypal or unnamed characters WITH named characters with specific occupations and backstories\n- REPLACE gimmicky objects as plot devices WITH character-driven emotional arcs and interactions\n- REPLACE harmonious or resolved interactions WITH explicit tension and unresolved emotional stakes\n- KEEP: bittersweet endings without forced resolution\n- ADD: specific, sensory-rich settings with tangible details (sounds, smells, textures)\n- ADD: layered dialogue and internal monologue to reveal emotional complexity\n- ADD: time jumps or reflective narration to deepen emotional impact",

    "**\"The Last Night at the Blue Horizon\"**  \nLena, a jazz pianist playing her final gig before moving to Berlin, locks eyes with Eli, a travel writer nursing a whiskey at the bar. They talk until sunrise—about his dead brother, her failed marriage, the way Miles Davis’s trumpet sounds like grief. The chemistry is undeniable, but Lena’s flight leaves in six hours. They wander the city, stealing kisses under bridges and sharing secrets in 24-hour diners, both knowing this can’t last. At the airport, Eli hands her a postcard with his handwriting: *“Play this one for me someday.”* Years later, in a Berlin jazz club, Lena spots a familiar face in the crowd. Eli doesn’t see her. She plays the melody they’d hummed together, but he’s gone by the last note.",
    "**\"The Book of Unfinished Recipes\"**  \nMira, a disgraced food critic, finds a handwritten cookbook in a secondhand shop in Lisbon. The margins are filled with notes by a man named Tomas, who wrote about his ex-wife’s love for paprika and his daughter’s peanut allergy. Mira starts cooking the recipes, adding her own notes. One day, Tomas walks into her pop-up dinner—a friend had recognized his handwriting in her Instagram posts. Over squid ink pasta, they bond over lost loves and burnt soufflés. But Tomas is moving to Canada for custody of his daughter, and Mira’s visa expires next week. They spend his last night in Lisbon drinking gin and crossing out recipe titles together: *“Unfinished,”* they rename them.",
    "**\"The Clockmaker’s Apprentice\"**  \nIn a tiny Kyoto watch repair shop, reserved clockmaker Ren trains Aiko, a loudmouthed American exchange student who talks to the broken timepieces. Ren is grieving his father’s death; Aiko is running from her family’s expectations. They bicker over Swiss vs. Japanese mechanisms but fall into quiet intimacy when Ren shows her how to listen for a watch’s heartbeat. One night, drunk on sake, Aiko kisses him. The next morning, she accepts a job in New York. Years later, Ren receives a package: a watch she’d repaired, engraved with *“You were right about the escapement.”* He smiles, winds it, and lets it stop.",
    "**\"The Ferryman’s Daughter\"**  \nEvery winter, Theo takes the same ferry to the Greek island of Hydra, where he writes poetry in the same taverna. This year, the ferryman’s daughter, Damaris, recognizes him—she’s memorized his order (ouzo, no ice) and the way he taps his pen when stuck. She confesses she’s been writing him letters she never sent. Theo, reeling from his mother’s death, finds solace in her words. But Damaris is engaged to a man her father chose, and Theo’s visa expires when the tourist season ends. On his last night, they read her letters aloud by the docks. He burns them one by one, the ashes floating over the black water.",
    "**\"The Archivists\"**  \nIn a dusty Buenos Aires archive, Clara (a historian researching disappeared activists) and Mateo (a filmmaker documenting empty playgrounds) keep crossing paths. They bond over shared lunches and the ache of preserving what’s been lost. Clara finds a photo of Mateo’s missing uncle in her files; he cries into her shoulder. But Clara is applying for a job in Madrid, and Mateo won’t leave his aging mother. On her last day, they slow-dance in the archive basement to a tango record, their shoes kicking up decades of dust. *“Tell them about us,”* he whispers. She doesn’t. The photo stays tucked in her notebook, fading at the edges."
