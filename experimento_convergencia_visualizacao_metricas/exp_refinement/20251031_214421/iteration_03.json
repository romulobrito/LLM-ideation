    "**\"The Last Proof\"**  \nA retired healthcare-tech CFO and a PR partner meet weekly at a Buckhead bakery to proofread each other’s personal writing—his memoir about losing his wife, her press releases for a failing art nonprofit. Their ritual involves red pens and shared almond croissants, their fingers brushing over crumpled pages. One afternoon, she admits she’s moving to Seville for a job; he doesn’t ask her to stay. Instead, they argue over a sentence in his draft: *“Grief is the only love that doesn’t change.”* She crosses it out. He puts it back. In the end, they leave the page between them on the table, ink smudged with rooftop rain, her flight ticket tucked inside like a bookmark.",
    "**\"Ansley Park, 3 AM\"**  \nA Black queer litigator and a white museum archivist keep bumping into each other at all-night diners after their respective breakups. They bond over burnt coffee and peeling laminate counters, dissecting their exes’ flaws with surgical precision. One night, the archivist traces the litigator’s knuckles and says, *“We’d ruin each other faster.”* They laugh, but it sticks. Months later, they run into each other at a gala—him in a tux, her in a dress neither can afford. They slow-dance to a jazz cover of *Landslide*, her teeth grazing his shoulder. At dawn, they part without exchanging numbers, both too aware of how perfectly they’d fit as casualties.",
    "**\"Margin Notes\"**  \nA divorced sommelier and a bilingual obituary writer trade used books with underlined passages at a Little Five Points bookstore. Their intimacy lives in the margins: *“This tastes like your laugh”* scrawled next to a description of apricots; *“You’d hate this guy”* beside a eulogy. When he’s offered a vineyard job in Mendoza, she hands him a copy of *Love in the Time of Cholera* with one final note: *“Don’t write to me.”* He doesn’t. But years later, at a wine auction, he spots her handwriting on a bidding card and pockets it like a pardon.",
    "**\"The Geometry of Wanting\"**  \nA geometry teacher and a muralist collide during a MARTA delay in downtown Atlanta. She’s obsessed with the angles of his hands; he’s mesmerized by her paint-stained overalls. They spend the afternoon arguing about whether love is a theorem or a scribble in the margins. When he kisses her against a graffiti-covered wall, she murmurs, *“This is just a tangent,”* and he agrees. They exchange emails but never send anything beyond drafts—half-finished thoughts about parallel lines and the color of regret. The last one reads: *“I keep trying to solve for you.”*",
    "**\"Rooftop Rules\"**  \nA Lebanese-American cardiologist and a Guatemalan film critic meet on their apartment building’s rooftop in Midtown, where they’ve both escaped insomnia. Their ritual: she brings spiced chocolate; he brings terrible B-movie synopses. One night, he admits his studio is relocating him to LA. She fists her hands in his shirt and says, *“Tell me you’ll miss this,”* and he does, vividly—the way she licks cinnamon off her thumb, how she corrects his Arabic. They spend his last week memorizing each other’s shadows against the skyline. On his final night, they don’t touch. They just watch a thunderstorm roll in, counting the seconds between lightning and sound."
