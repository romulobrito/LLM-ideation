  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or personal challenges, and they are typically professionals or creatives, adding depth and relatability.\n- Settings are specific and often urban or culturally rich, such as cities or unique locales, which serve as more than just backdrops but integral parts of the narrative.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, with a focus on emotional growth and self-discovery rather than external obstacles, often leading to bittersweet or unresolved endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of connection, longing, and the complexity of human relationships, often with a melancholic or reflective tone.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke atmosphere and emotion, with dialogue that reveals character depth and unspoken truths.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE Gimmicky plot devices (e.g., time travel, silent window signs) WITH Realistic, character-driven scenarios grounded in everyday life (e.g., shared meals, walks, workplace interactions)\n- REPLACE Underdeveloped characters with minimal backstory WITH Named characters with specific occupations, histories, and emotional baggage (e.g., twice-divorced PR partner, grieving married man)\n- ADD: Sensory details and intimate physical moments (e.g., touch, taste, shared private rituals) to deepen emotional connection\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings where characters part ways without forced resolution\n- ADD: Extended timelines showing relationship evolution over weeks, months, or years with gradual emotional buildup\n- REPLACE Generic settings (e.g., café, train station) WITH Specific, evocative locations that enhance mood and character dynamics (e.g., art openings, lakeside towns, bookstore stacks)\n- ADD: Internal monologue and character reflections to explore yearning, doubt, and complicated emotions",

    "**The Last Light of the Savoy**\nArthur, a widowed architect in his late fifties, meets Elara, a landscape painter, when they are both hired to consult on the restoration of a decaying Art Deco hotel. Over months of shared lunches amidst blueprints and paint samples, they bond over a shared love of forgotten beauty and the quiet weight of their pasts—his grief, her recent divorce. Their connection deepens during late evenings in the empty ballroom, their conversations illuminated by the sunset through stained-glass windows. They share one tender, hesitant kiss in the hotel’s overgrown rooftop garden. But the project ends, the hotel is sold to a chain, and Elara accepts a residency abroad. They part not with anger, but with a profound, unspoken understanding that their timing was a lifetime off, their relationship as beautifully unfinished as the hotel once was.",
    "**The Cartographer of Lost Places**\nMaya, a freelance cartographer with a quiet, observant nature, meets Leo, a charismatic historian leading weekly walking tours of the city’s hidden alleys. For a summer, she becomes his most regular attendee, their post-walk coffees evolving into long conversations about urban legends and personal histories. He traces the city's forgotten paths; she draws them, giving him a personalized map of his favorite route for his birthday, her feelings coded in the illustrations. The intimacy builds in shared silences and brushes of hands over old stone walls. Yet, Leo is bound for a tenured position across the country, a dream he cannot abandon. On his last day, they walk his route one final time, the air thick with everything unsaid, parting with a tight hug that feels like a destination they’ll never reach.",
    "**Second-Hand Lives**\nClara, a twice-divorced rare book dealer, and Ben, a softly-spoken librarian mourning his late wife, find their orbits intersecting daily in the hushed stacks of the university library. Their relationship is a slow burn of exchanged book recommendations and coffee breaks, their conversations a delicate dance around their respective baggage. The connection is in the details: the way he saves the last scone for her, the scent of old paper on his jacket when he helps her with a heavy volume. For a year, they are each other’s most comforting routine. But Ben’s grief is a room Clara knows she can never fully enter. He ultimately takes a job in a smaller, quieter town, seeking a different kind of peace. They say goodbye not as lovers, but as two people who briefly loaned each other a necessary solace.",
    "**The Conservationist's Gaze**\nIsla, an art conservator in her forties, is hired to restore a series of murals in a local gallery. The artist, Julian, a man ten years her senior weathered by life and loss, is permitted to observe. Over weeks, a quiet understanding grows as she meticulously uncovers his decades-old work and he shares the stories behind each brushstroke. Their interactions are a ballet of proximity and restraint—his hand guiding hers to feel a texture, the shared warmth of a thermos of tea. The restored mural is a triumph, a testament to their collaboration. At the opening, surrounded by admirers, they share a look of pure, aching pride. He is tied to the city by family; she has a job offer on another continent. They part with a chaste kiss on the cheek, a masterpiece of connection forever preserved under varnish.",
    "**Seasonal Affective**\nLena, a pragmatic botanist, and Theo, a melancholic writer, are next-door neighbors in an old city apartment building. Their friendship blooms over three years, marked by seasonal rituals: shoveling snow from the shared steps, tending the tiny rooftop garden, sharing a bottle of wine on the fire escape during humid summer nights. They know each other’s coffee orders and heartbreaks. The possibility of more hangs in the air, a delicate, un-picked fruit. But Theo’s introspection borders on paralysis, and Lena’s practicality demands forward motion. When she is offered a lead research role in a rainforest biome thousands of miles away, he helps her pack. Their final goodbye is in the autumn, surrounded by boxes and the dying plants on the roof, a relationship that was perfectly real but never quite in season."
