  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or personal challenges, and they are typically professionals or creatives, adding depth and relatability.\n- Settings are specific and often urban or culturally rich, such as cities or unique locales, which serve as more than just backdrops but integral parts of the narrative.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, with a focus on emotional growth and self-discovery rather than external obstacles, often leading to bittersweet or unresolved endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of connection, longing, and the complexity of human relationships, often with a melancholic or reflective tone.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke atmosphere and emotion, with dialogue that reveals character depth and unspoken truths.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE Symbolic or gimmicky concepts centered on objects (e.g., tiles, sound recordings, dictionaries) that drive the plot WITH Character-driven stories with emotional depth focused on personal interactions and growth in realistic settings\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings where characters acknowledge the impossibility of a future together\n- ADD: Specific, sensory details of physical intimacy and shared rituals (e.g., touches, tastes, smells) to deepen emotional connection\n- REPLACE Overly intellectual or thematic professions that define characters (e.g., lexicographer, sound engineer) WITH Diverse, relatable occupations (e.g., PR partner, retired CFO, young mother) that inform backstory without overshadowing emotional core\n- ADD: Internal character reflections and dialogues that explore fears, doubts, and desires, highlighting the complexity of connection\n- REPLACE Romanticized, exotic city settings (e.g., Lisbon, Paris, Berlin) that feel like backdrops WITH Grounded, specific locations (e.g., Buckhead gala, Starbucks, Modest Mouse show) that enhance emotional reality and immersion\n- KEEP: Themes of yearning and fleeting connections, even when complicated or out of reach",

    "The Last Setup\nMaya, a pragmatic graphic designer, and Leo, a warm-hearted high school teacher, are set up by mutual friends. Their connection is immediate and deep, forged over weekly dinners where they share stories of their pasts—his divorce, her caring for an ailing parent. They develop a ritual of making pasta from scratch, the feel of flour-dusted hands and the smell of simmering garlic creating a fragile intimacy. They talk for hours about their fears and quiet ambitions, but the timing is catastrophically wrong; Leo is being transferred across the country to care for his own family. In their last meeting, they share a perfect, final meal, acknowledging with tear-filled smiles that this profound, loving connection must remain a beautiful, closed chapter.",
    "The Laundromat at 2 AM\nElena, a night-shift nurse, and Ben, a bartender, orbit each other in the quiet hum of a 24-hour laundromat. Their relationship exists in this liminal space, built on shared coffee from the vending machine and the warm, clean smell of dryers. He folds her scrubs; she listens to his stories about difficult customers. There is a gentle physical ease—a hand on the shoulder when she’s tired, his head briefly resting against her leg as he sits on the floor. They both know it can’t translate to the real world; he’s leaving in a month for law school, and her life is rooted here by duty and choice. Their last night is spent in silent companionship, watching the tumbling clothes, until they say a quiet goodbye, leaving the clean, folded stack of their lives between them.",
    "The Commute\nSofia, a physical therapist, and James, a carpenter, share the same morning commuter train. For months, their connection is built in glances and small kindnesses—he gives up his seat, she offers a smile when he looks tired. One rainy day, they finally speak. The conversations become a daily ritual, a bright spot in their routines. They share details of their lives: his struggle with his father’s workshop, her longing to travel. There’s a palpable charge when their arms brush in the crowded aisle. But they never exchange numbers, both sensing the unspoken rule of this transient space. When James gets a new job with a different route, their final journey is filled with a heavy, knowing silence—a perfect, fleeting understanding that some connections are meant only for the journey, not the destination.",
    "The Project Partner\nChloe, an organized PR associate, is paired with Kai, a charismatic but scattered freelance photographer, for a high-stakes campaign. Over weeks of late nights in a sterile office, they build a rhythm. They learn each other's coffee orders, and he gently teases her for her color-coded spreadsheets. A moment of shared exhaustion leads to a kiss that tastes of cold brew and vulnerability, a spark of something real. They confess their fears of never being enough in their careers and lives. The project is a wild success, but as they celebrate, they acknowledge the truth: their dynamic works within the pressure cooker of a shared goal, but their life trajectories—her need for stability, his nomadic freedom—are fundamentally incompatible. They part as profound admirers, but not partners.",
    "The Regulars\nDavid, a retired CFO grappling with loneliness, and Anya, a young mother who writes poetry during her only free hour, are daily regulars at the same neighborhood Starbucks. They sit at adjacent tables, and a friendship grows from a borrowed charger to shared complaints about the coffee’s acidity. He talks about his late wife; she shares the suffocating beauty of motherhood. They develop a ritual of splitting a blueberry scone, a small, sweet shared ritual. There is a deep, platonic affection, a touch on the hand that speaks volumes. But when Anya’s husband gets a new job in another state, their last meeting is a heartfelt farewell. They promise to keep in touch, both knowing they won’t, cherishing the temporary shelter they provided each other."
