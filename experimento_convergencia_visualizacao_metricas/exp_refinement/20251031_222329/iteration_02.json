  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or personal challenges, and they are typically professionals or creatives, adding depth and relatability.\n- Settings are specific and often urban or culturally rich, such as cities or unique locales, which serve as more than just backdrops but integral parts of the narrative.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, with a focus on emotional growth and self-discovery rather than external obstacles, often leading to bittersweet or unresolved endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of connection, longing, and the complexity of human relationships, often with a melancholic or reflective tone.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke atmosphere and emotion, with dialogue that reveals character depth and unspoken truths.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE archetypal or generic character descriptions WITH named characters who have specific occupations, backstories, and personal histories\n- REPLACE gimmicky or high-concept plot devices WITH realistic, grounded scenarios centered on emotional connections and shared experiences\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings where characters part ways without a happily ever after, emphasizing the beauty in impermanence\n- ADD: Deep exploration of characters' internal emotions, fears, and personal growth through nuanced interactions and reflections\n- REPLACE endings reliant on misunderstandings or coincidental missed connections WITH endings based on conscious, mutual decisions or the natural conclusion of circumstances\n- ADD: Specific rituals, shared activities, and sensory details that symbolize and deepen the connection between characters\n- REPLACE minimal or superficial dialogue and interactions WITH rich, meaningful dialogue and banter that reveal character depth, emotional tension, and shared understanding",

    "**The Lisbon Pavement Artist**\nElias, a jaded architect on sabbatical, meets Clara, a Portuguese tile painter restoring a historic chapel. Their connection sparks during long afternoons where he sketches structural details and she paints intricate azulejos. They share stories of past failures—his divorce, her father’s fading workshop—over glasses of vinho verde, their fingers brushing against shared blueprints. The city of Lisbon, with its steep hills and melancholic fado music, becomes a character in their brief, intense bond. They don’t fall in love so much as they recognize a kindred solitude. When his sabbatical ends, they make a conscious, tender decision not to exchange numbers, understanding their purpose was to offer each other a moment of repair, not a new foundation. The story ends with Elias tracing the tile she gifted him on the flight home.",
    "**The Last Service at Le Repos**\nMargot, a sommelier mastering a Parisian wine cellar, and Jean-Paul, a chef who inherited his family’s failing bistro, find solace in their shared, silent dedication to craft. Their relationship exists almost entirely in the lull after closing: tasting new pairings, debating the merits of obscure Burgundies, and confessing fears of not living up to legacies. The bistro, \"Le Repos,\" with its worn velvet banquettes and the scent of reduced shallots, is their sanctuary. Their connection is deep but rooted in this specific, dying place. When the building is finally sold, they share one last perfect meal. They part not with a kiss, but with a firm, understanding handshake, two professionals acknowledging that some beautiful things are meant to be ephemeral, like a perfect sauce that cannot be replicated.",
    "**The Berlin U-Bahn Recordings**\nLeo, a sound engineer haunted by his brother's ghost, meets Anya, a neurologist studying the effect of city sounds on memory. They begin a project recording the acoustics of Berlin's U-Bahn stations, their partnership built on shared early mornings capturing the rhythm of trains and snippets of passing conversations. In the control room, their banter is a mix of technical jargon and profound revelations about loss and how we remember. A specific ritual develops: sharing a single pastry while reviewing the day’s recordings. The intimacy grows, but Anya accepts a research position in Montreal. In their final session, they listen back to a recording of their own laughter echoing in an empty station—a perfect, preserved moment of connection they both choose to leave untouched, a beautiful memory without a future.",
    "**The Book of Unspoken Things**\nArthur, a widowed bookbinder in his sixties, agrees to mentor Chloe, a sharp, restless lexicographer in her thirties who is compiling a dictionary of obsolete words. In his dusty London workshop, they find a quiet kinship through the tactile rituals of repairing broken spines and discussing words like “lachesism” (the desire to be struck by disaster) and “vellichor” (the strange wistfulness of used bookshops). Their dialogue is a dance of intellectual curiosity and unacknowledged grief. Chloe eventually confesses a job offer in another country. They share one last pot of tea, and he gifts her a hand-bound, blank journal. The ending is a mutual, unspoken acknowledgment that their season of healing together is over, a bittersweet closing of a chapter that was necessary but finite.",
    "**The Night Shift at the All-Night Diner**\nSasha, an insomniac paramedic, and Ben, a night-shift editor for a local paper, become fixtures at the same 24-hour diner in Seattle. Their relationship is built from 2 AM conversations over bad coffee, a shared space for decompressing from the city’s nightly tragedies. They develop a ritual of splitting a slice of cherry pie, a small, sweet rebellion against the darkness they both navigate. Their banter is laced with the gallows humor of their professions and a deep, unspoken understanding of each other’s fatigue. The connection is real, but so is the understanding that they are each other’s port in a storm, not a destination. When Ben finally lands a day-job columnist position, they celebrate with pie at noon, a disorienting but fitting end to their nocturnal friendship, parting as grateful allies."
