  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or personal challenges, and they are typically professionals or creatives, adding depth and relatability.\n- Settings are specific and often urban or culturally rich, such as cities or unique locales, which serve as more than just backdrops but integral parts of the narrative.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, with a focus on emotional growth and self-discovery rather than external obstacles, often leading to bittersweet or unresolved endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of connection, longing, and the complexity of human relationships, often with a melancholic or reflective tone.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke atmosphere and emotion, with dialogue that reveals character depth and unspoken truths.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE Characters with basic occupational descriptions (e.g., 'graphic designer', 'teacher') WITH Characters with specific backstories and emotional baggage (e.g., 'twice-divorced PR partner', 'grieving losses that taught him to expect endings')\n- REPLACE Generic settings like laundromats or coffee shops without symbolic weight WITH Settings that metaphorically represent the connection (e.g., 'Modest Mouse show' for shared history, 'bookstore' for intellectual exchange')\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings where characters part ways without a future together\n- ADD: Sensual or physical intimacy details (e.g., 'his hands in her hair', 'her teeth at his shoulder') to illustrate the depth of the relationship\n- REPLACE Straightforward plot progression focused on external circumstances WITH Layered emotional arcs with internal conflict and conscious decisions (e.g., 'choosing clarity over comfort', 'deliberately unfinished')\n- ADD: Narrative framing or meta-commentary (e.g., citing tragic romances or philosophical insights about love) to contextualize the story\n- KEEP: The use of recurring rituals or encounters (e.g., weekly dinners, seasonal meetings) to build the connection",

    "The Cartography of Loss\nLeo, a widowed archivist still numbed by his wife's death three years prior, meets Clara, a freelance cartographer grieving a recent miscarriage that ended her marriage. They connect at a silent reading night at a historic library, their bond forming over shared glances and the rustle of pages. Their relationship unfolds through a ritual of weekly walks, mapping the city's forgotten alleys. The intimacy is deep and physical—her head resting on his shoulder, his hand steadying the small of her back as they navigate uneven cobblestones. They are two people who understand loss, and in each other, find a temporary harbor. But Clara yearns for a future, for children, while Leo’s heart remains a preserved specimen in the archive of his past. In a final, tender moment in the map room, they acknowledge they are each other’s beautiful, temporary bridge, not the destination. They part, two experts in endings, choosing a clean, conscious close over a protracted, painful fade.",
    "The Kintsukuroi Principle\nMaya, a ceramicist haunted by the collapse of her artist collective, and Ben, a former war correspondent with PTSD who now builds custom furniture, meet at a raku firing workshop. Their connection is immediate, a meeting of two broken but mending souls. They begin a ritual of shared Sunday dinners, where the conversation is as layered as the glazes on her pottery. The physical pull is undeniable; his wood-dust-roughened hands tracing the hairline fractures of a repaired bowl, her lips finding the scar on his shoulder from a long-healed wound. They talk of kintsukuroi, the Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold, making the damage a celebrated part of the object's history. One night, Ben confesses he is leaving to cover a conflict abroad, a calling he cannot ignore. They make love for the last time, a desperate, gilded repair. They part knowing some breaks are too fundamental; their love was the gold that highlighted the crack, not the glue that could hold them together.",
    "The Last Ferry to Waiheke\nElena, a sommelier still reeling from a toxic relationship with a renowned chef, and Alex, a travel writer perpetually fleeing commitment after a childhood of constant relocation, share a bottle of wine on the last ferry from Waiheke Island. He is a connoisseur of departures, she of finishes. Their ensuing affair is a whirlwind of Auckland’s hidden bars and early morning fish markets, a series of intense, curated encounters. The sensuality is precise: the taste of Sauvignon Blanc on his lips, the feel of her teeth gently biting his shoulder in a crowded elevator. They quote Rilke and Didion to each other, philosophizing about love as a form of beautiful, necessary ruin. But when Alex receives a assignment for a year-long project in Patagonia, Elena does not ask him to stay. She knows, as he does, that their connection was a perfect, finite vintage—meant to be savored, not cellared. They share a final, knowing kiss at the terminal, a deliberate and unfinished ending.",
    "The Curator of Almost-Loves\nArthur, a twice-divorced museum curator specializing in artifacts of failed civilizations, and Sylvie, a jaded literary agent who has built her career on other people’s stories, meet at a gallery opening for a photographer known for capturing abandoned places. They are drawn together by a shared cynicism that masks a deep yearning. Their relationship becomes a ritual of post-event debriefs in his stark, modern apartment, where the intellectual and physical merge—his fingers in her hair as they deconstruct the evening’s pretensions, her laugh against his neck. Sylvie jokes they are collecting each other, another exhibit in their personal museums of almost-loves. The end comes not with a fight, but with a quiet realization over a bottle of expensive Scotch. To continue would be to become a cliché they themselves would critique: the lonely professionals finding comfort. They choose clarity over comfort, parting as curators of their own solitude, preserving the perfection of their short, intense run.",
    "The Seasonal Gardener\nIsla, a botanist recovering from a broken engagement, and Tom, a landscape architect who left his family's business after a bitter falling-out, have a standing, unspoken agreement: they meet only during the spring and summer open days of a renowned botanical garden. For two seasons a year, they walk the grounds, their conversations as meandering and deep-rooted as the wisteria tunnels. Their intimacy is seasonal and chaste yet profoundly sensual: the brush of his hand against hers as they examine a peony, the scent of damp earth and her perfume mingling in the greenhouse. They share everything except their lives outside those walls. He is a man who expects endings, she a woman who studies cycles of growth and decay. When the last summer open day ends, they stand at the gate, knowing that to transplant this delicate, seasonal thing into the harsh weather of the real world would kill it. They part with a soft smile, a connection consciously shelved until the next bloom, which they both know will never come."
