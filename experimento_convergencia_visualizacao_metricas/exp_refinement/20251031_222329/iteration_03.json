  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or personal challenges, and they are typically professionals or creatives, adding depth and relatability.\n- Settings are specific and often urban or culturally rich, such as cities or unique locales, which serve as more than just backdrops but integral parts of the narrative.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, with a focus on emotional growth and self-discovery rather than external obstacles, often leading to bittersweet or unresolved endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of connection, longing, and the complexity of human relationships, often with a melancholic or reflective tone.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke atmosphere and emotion, with dialogue that reveals character depth and unspoken truths.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE endings characterized by unspoken understanding or silent partings WITH endings where characters explicitly discuss their limitations and reasons for parting\n- REPLACE subtle or chaste physical contact WITH visceral, sensory physical intimacy with details like touch, scent, and bodily sensations\n- ADD: Named characters with specific, detailed backstories and occupations that drive their motivations and conflicts\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings without resolution, emphasizing the lack of a happily ever after\n- REPLACE separation driven primarily by external factors like job moves or project endings WITH parting driven by internal emotional conflicts, personal fears, or mutual recognition of incompatibility\n- ADD: Explicit emotional dialogue where characters verbally express love, doubt, or deep feelings directly\n- REPLACE romanticized or exotic settings WITH grounded, specific settings with rich sensory details",

    "**The Cartographer of Lost Places**\nLeo, a historian preserving dying neighborhoods, and Elara, a real estate developer, meet while she’s assessing his street for demolition. Their connection is immediate and fierce, forged over late nights arguing in his archive-filled apartment, the scent of old paper and their shared whiskey mingling in the air. They fall into an intense physical intimacy, her sharp, citrus perfume a stark contrast to the dusty smell of his books on his skin. One night, pressed together on his floor, she traces the map of a vanished city on his back and whispers she loves the man he is, but not the world he clings to. He admits he can’t love a woman whose success is measured by erasing his life’s work. They part not with anger, but with the agonizing clarity that their fundamental values are incompatible.",
    "**The Last Set**\nJin, a jazz pianist grappling with creative block after a bitter divorce, and Clara, a lyricist whose husband is in long-term care, find solace in a late-night collaboration at a near-empty downtown club. The chemistry is in their work, their hands brushing over sheet music, the taste of gin sharp on their tongues. They create one perfect, heartbreaking song together, their bodies moving in sync as easily as their harmonies. After the final note fades, Clara rests her head on his shoulder, the wool of his jacket scratchy against her cheek. “I have a love,” she says, her voice thick. “He’s just not here anymore.” Jin replies, “And I’m too broken to be anyone’s second choice.” They leave the club separately, the ghost of their song hanging in the air between them.",
    "**The Kintsugi Chef**\nSasha, a chef specializing in modernizing forgotten recipes, and Alex, a food critic renowned for her brutal honesty, begin a clandestine affair after a scathing review turns into a charged debate. Their relationship is a sensory explosion: the feel of flour-dusted hands, the taste of experimental dishes at 3 AM, the smell of garlic and sweat in her kitchen. The intimacy is a language of its own, a raw repair for their professional wounds. But when Alex is offered a prestigious role that requires unwavering critical detachment, she confesses, “I can’t write honestly about food if I’m in love with the cook.” Sasha, gripping the counter still sticky with reduced balsamic, agrees. “And I’ll never know if my food is truly good, or just good for you.”",
    "**The Blueprint of Us**\nTwo architects, Mateo and Isabelle, are forced to collaborate on a museum project. He is a minimalist, haunted by the clutter of his chaotic childhood; she is a maximalist, filling spaces to outrun the silence of a lonely one. Their arguments over design evolve into a deep, physical understanding, their bodies finding a perfect, breathless architecture in her bed amid sketches and models. During the project’s unveiling, standing before their compromised but brilliant design, Isabelle says, “We built something beautiful by fighting for every inch.” Mateo takes her hand, feeling the calluses on her fingers. “But a home,” he replies, “shouldn’t be a battleground. We want to live in different worlds.” They share one last, desperate kiss, a final design they can never build upon.",
    "**The Archivist's Echo**\nClara, a sound engineer restoring damaged audio archives, discovers a series of intimate, decades-old interviews with a renowned, now-reclusive poet, Samuel. When she tracks him down to complete her project, she finds a sharp, lonely man in a cluttered house smelling of ink and dust. As they work, a profound connection forms, punctuated by the warmth of his hand guiding hers over old recording equipment, the static buzz of tape a constant hum. After they finish, he confesses he’s fallen in love with the way she’s reassembled his past. She touches his face, her fingers tracing the lines of his history. “But I only love the man you were on these tapes,” she whispers. “I came to find a ghost, not to build a future.” He nods, the truth settling in the silent room."
