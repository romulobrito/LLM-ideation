  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or personal challenges, and they are typically professionals or creatives, adding depth and relatability.\n- Settings are specific and often urban or culturally rich, such as cities or unique locales, which serve as more than just backdrops but integral parts of the narrative.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, with a focus on emotional growth and self-discovery rather than external obstacles, often leading to bittersweet or unresolved endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of connection, longing, and the complexity of human relationships, often with a melancholic or reflective tone.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke atmosphere and emotion, with dialogue that reveals character depth and unspoken truths.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE abstract or gimmicky concepts as central plot devices (e.g., margin notes, shared wall, last train) WITH character-driven emotional arcs grounded in specific actions and interactions, like shared meals or walks\n- REPLACE characters defined primarily by archetypal grief or pasts WITH named characters with specific occupations, backstories, and personal conflicts (e.g., divorced PR partner, retired CFO)\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings without forced resolution, where characters consciously part ways\n- ADD: Vivid sensory details and physical intimacies (e.g., hands in hair, teeth at shoulder) to enhance emotional depth\n- REPLACE quiet, understated endings without a clear turning point WITH defined hinge moments or catalysts (e.g., job offers, realizations) that lead to separation\n- KEEP: Themes of yearning and connection in fleeting or complicated relationships\n- ADD: Direct dialogue and conversations that reveal character emotions and deepen connection",

    "The Last Loaf\nElias, a recently divorced baker originally from Lisbon, and Clara, a widowed British archivist restoring a local library, meet every morning at his shop for her daily loaf of sourdough. Their connection, built over the flour-dusted counter, is a quiet ritual of soft smiles and the brief touch of fingers during exchange. He teaches her Portuguese words for the textures of bread; she brings him historical maps of his hometown. The hinge moment comes when Clara’s project finishes. Over a final, shared meal of bread and cheese at dawn, he doesn’t ask her to stay and she doesn’t ask him to leave. They both know her life is a world of catalogued silence, and his is one of warm, public kneading. Their parting is a conscious, tender severance, a ghost of flour left on her black coat.",
    "The Cello and the Compressor\nMaya, a sound engineer still haunted by the failure of her previous band, is recording ambient city noise when she captures the mournful cello of Leo, a former prodigy grappling with a degenerative hand tremor. Their collaboration in her studio—her adjusting microphones to capture the fading strength in his vibrato, his music giving shape to her abstract soundscapes—becomes intensely intimate. During a late session, she rests her head against his back to feel the music resonate, her hands briefly stilling his shaking one. The catalyst is a prestigious, distant fellowship Leo applies for out of desperation. He gets it, a bittersweet victory. On his last day, they record one final, raw track. They don’t say goodbye; they just listen to the playback, a perfect, preserved moment of their connection, knowing it can’t last.",
    "The Conservator's Cracks\nArthur, a pragmatic art conservator specializing in porcelain, meets Anya, a passionate but struggling ceramicist, when she visits his museum gallery. He is quietly recovering from a broken engagement; she is fleeing a suffocating family business. He admires the bold cracks in her own work; she teases him for only loving \"finished, fragile things.\" Their relationship unfolds during long walks through the museum, their conversations a dance of repair and deconstruction. The turning point is a job offer for Arthur to lead a restoration project in Rome. He asks her to come, but she refuses, knowing she would become another one of his beautiful, mended objects, her own sharp edges smoothed away. Their final kiss in the empty gallery feels like a clean break, a fracture they both choose not to repair.",
    "The Ghostwriter's Shadow\nBen, a ghostwriter adept at crafting other people’s love stories, meets Sofia, a pragmatic literary agent, at a book launch. He is secretly writing a novel based on his late brother’s life; she is professionally brilliant but personally lonely, guarding a past bankruptcy. They connect through shared lunches where they critique bad manuscripts and reveal their own guarded hopes. The intimacy is in the details: the way she tucks a loose strand of hair behind his ear, the taste of coffee they share from the same cup. The catalyst is Sofia securing Ben a lucrative, long-term contract that requires him to move across the country to work closely with a reclusive author. They have one last lunch, a conversation full of unspoken love and logistical impossibilities, ending with a hug that lasts just a moment too long.",
    "The Blueprint of Us\nDavid, a retired, meticulous architect, and Lena, a spontaneous travel blogger, are next-door neighbors in a Barcelona apartment block. He is reeling from his firm's forced retirement of him; she is between trips, hiding from a failed travel venture. Their connection sparks during shared evenings on their adjacent balconies, the scent of jasmine and city dust between them. He draws; she talks. The hinge moment is Lena landing a contract for a year-long blog series sailing the Mediterranean. The night before she leaves, they finally act on their attraction, a desperate, tender collision of lips and hands in hair, teeth at shoulders, a blueprint of a life they’ll never build. In the morning, they part with a smile, two people who met at the wrong station, watching the other’s train depart."
