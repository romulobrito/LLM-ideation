  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often embody contrasting traits or life stages, such as youth versus experience, or idealism versus realism, creating dynamic interactions and internal conflicts.\n- Settings are frequently specific and atmospheric, serving as more than just backdrops; they often reflect or enhance the emotional tone and themes, such as a winter landscape symbolizing emotional distance.\n- Plots revolve around unresolved or unfulfilled connections, with a focus on missed opportunities or the inability to bridge gaps, often due to external circumstances or internal hesitations.\n- Emotional arcs are characterized by a sense of yearning and bittersweet resolution, where characters experience growth or change despite not achieving a traditional happy ending.\n- Literary devices such as metaphors and symbolism are used to deepen the narrative, with recurring motifs like light and darkness or bridges representing connection and separation.\n- Dialogue is often introspective and layered, revealing character depth and unspoken truths, while also highlighting the tension between what is said and what is left unsaid.\n- Themes of class, duty, and personal sacrifice are prevalent, exploring how societal roles and personal obligations impact personal relationships and individual desires.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE generic settings (e.g., 'a cozy bookshop', 'a bustling city') WITH specific, textured settings with symbolic weight (e.g., 'a blood-scrubbed hotel room', 'a drought-stricken village')\n- REPLACE archetypal professions (musician, photographer, barista) WITH occupations with narrative stakes (e.g., detective embroiled in corruption, Roman centurion, architecture student tending to a dying bookstore)\n- ADD: unresolved mysteries or hidden histories that linger beneath the surface of the relationship\n- ADD: class or power dynamics that create tangible barriers to the characters' connection\n- KEEP: bittersweet endings where characters choose separate paths for believable reasons\n- REPLACE brief, implied backstories WITH detailed personal histories that actively shape present choices\n- ADD: physical artifacts with deep emotional weight and specific histories that mirror the characters' conflict",

    "**The Last Ferry to Alcatraz**  \nA retired prison guard and a historian researching inmate letters meet on the final public ferry to Alcatraz before it closes for restoration. He’s haunted by the suicide of a young prisoner he couldn’t protect; she’s obsessed with the inmate’s final, unsent letter to a lover. As they walk the crumbling cellblocks, their shared fixation on the dead man’s story sparks an uneasy kinship. But when she discovers the guard’s name in the prison logbooks from that fateful night, their fragile connection fractures. The ferry’s horn sounds—one last departure. He stays behind on the island, staring at the water, while she clutches the yellowed envelope, both carrying different versions of the same ghost.",
    "**Borrowed Light**  \nIn a drought-stricken Arizona town, a solar engineer installing panels on a derelict observatory bonds with the astronomer’s widow who still charts stars out of habit. He’s running from his family’s failed farm; she’s waiting for a comet her husband predicted. When he fixes the old telescope, they spend nights tracking celestial bodies neither can name. The morning water ration notices arrive—her land is being seized for pipeline construction, his contract transferred. They share one last dawn watching Venus fade, her hand brushing his over the telescope’s brass fittings. He leaves the Navajo blanket she lent him folded on the porch, its geometric patterns mirroring the constellations they’ll never map together.",
    "**The Taxidermist’s Daughter**  \nA young woman preserving her late father’s zoology specimens encounters a hunter who brings in a rare lynx—the same species her eco-terrorist mother released from a fur farm years ago. Their debates over conservation vs. survival grow heated over formaldehyde jars, but when she finds her mother’s initials carved inside the lynx’s crate, she realizes he’s the warden who arrested her. He knows. The unspoken truth coils between them like the lynx’s stiffened tail. She leaves him the key to her father’s workshop, where the thawing lynx slowly sags into something neither wild nor art.",
    "**Five Kinds of Silence**  \nAt a 1920s Berlin clinic for shell-shocked soldiers, a mute pianist and a speech therapist develop a language of sheet music and pressed flowers. He communicates through Chopin études; she pins his carnations to a corkboard, each color representing an emotion. When she’s ordered to transfer to Vienna, he hands her a composition titled *Five Kinds of Silence*. On the train, she unfolds the score to find five blank measures—and her own dried forget-me-nots pressed between the pages. The clinic burns his piano the day after armistice, its strings snapping like unanswered questions.",
    "**The Bridge Tender’s Rule**  \nA Cuban exile operating a drawbridge in Key West falls for a Haitian migrant who passes daily on her fishing boat. Their fleeting exchanges—a mango tossed to her deck, his radio tuned to her favorite kompa song—halt when ICE raids the marina. He hesitates to raise the bridge, trapping her boat between barriers as patrol trucks approach. She screams for him to lift it. The gears groan; saltwater widens the gap. Months later, he finds her orange life vest snagged on the mechanism, its frayed straps still smelling of lime and gasoline."
