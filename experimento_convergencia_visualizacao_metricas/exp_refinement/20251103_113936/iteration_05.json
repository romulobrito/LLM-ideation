  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often embody contrasting traits or life stages, such as youth versus experience, or idealism versus realism, creating dynamic interactions and internal conflicts.\n- Settings are frequently specific and atmospheric, serving as more than just backdrops; they often reflect or enhance the emotional tone and themes, such as a winter landscape symbolizing emotional distance.\n- Plots revolve around unresolved or unfulfilled connections, with a focus on missed opportunities or the inability to bridge gaps, often due to external circumstances or internal hesitations.\n- Emotional arcs are characterized by a sense of yearning and bittersweet resolution, where characters experience growth or change despite not achieving a traditional happy ending.\n- Literary devices such as metaphors and symbolism are used to deepen the narrative, with recurring motifs like light and darkness or bridges representing connection and separation.\n- Dialogue is often introspective and layered, revealing character depth and unspoken truths, while also highlighting the tension between what is said and what is left unsaid.\n- Themes of class, duty, and personal sacrifice are prevalent, exploring how societal roles and personal obligations impact personal relationships and individual desires.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE archetypal unnamed characters WITH named characters with detailed backstories and occupations\n- REPLACE gimmicky concepts centered on objects WITH character-driven stories with emotional depth\n- ADD: Complex conflicts that test characters' values and relationships\n- ADD: Specific historical or cultural settings that enrich the narrative\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings without forced resolution\n- KEEP: Exploration of fleeting connections and unfulfilled desires\n- ADD: Dialogue that reveals character depth and emotional tension",
