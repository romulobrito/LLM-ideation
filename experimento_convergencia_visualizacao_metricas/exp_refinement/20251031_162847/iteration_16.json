  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or personal challenges, with occupations that suggest a degree of sophistication or ambition (e.g., professionals, creatives).\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as urban environments or culturally rich locations, which contribute to the mood and are integral to the story's emotional landscape.\n- Plots revolve around internal conflicts and the tension between desire and duty, with a structure that includes a build-up of intimacy followed by a poignant separation or realization.\n- Emotional arcs are characterized by a tone of bittersweet nostalgia, focusing on themes of connection, missed opportunities, and the acceptance of impermanence.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and emotion, with dialogue that is often introspective and reveals deeper truths about the characters' inner lives.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE archetypal, unnamed characters WITH named characters who have detailed backstories and specific occupations.\n- REPLACE mundane or transient settings WITH vivid, story-specific settings that are integral to the emotional arc.\n- REPLACE subtle or implied intimacy without physical details WITH explicit descriptions of emotional and physical intimacy that deepen the connection.\n- ADD: A reflective narrative voice or framing device that comments on the nature of love and impermanence.\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings where characters acknowledge the connection but part ways, without forced resolution.\n- ADD: Detailed and meaningful rituals that symbolize the relationship.\n- REPLACE gimmicky concepts centered on objects or activities WITH character-driven emotional arcs where the plot emerges from personal histories and growth.",

    "**The Cartography of Loss**\nLena, a literary translator working on a Japanese novel about impermanence, and Ben, an architect designing a temporary pavilion, meet at an artist's residency in Lisbon. Their connection is immediate and deep, forged over shared meals of pastéis de nata and late-night walks through the Alfama district, where they confide their pasts—his divorce, her recent widowhood. Their intimacy culminates in a poignant ritual: tracing maps of each other's scars on skin, a silent language of past hurts. The story is framed by Lena, years later, translating a passage that perfectly captures their affair. They part when the residency ends, not with regret, but with a profound acknowledgment that they were necessary waypoints for each other, temporary shelters in a season of grief.",
    "**The Last Service**\nClara, a food critic hiding her profession, and Mateo, the chef of a legendary, financially-struggling French bistro in New York, connect over a series of anonymous review meals. He confides in the \"regular\" about his fear of losing his family's legacy; she falls for the man behind the recipes. Their relationship blooms in the liminal space after closing time, sharing glasses of wine and stories over the stainless steel pass. The explicit intimacy is in the feeding—the way he plates a dish just for her, the way she understands its language. When the restaurant's closure becomes inevitable, they share one last perfect meal, a deliberate and beautiful ending. She never writes the review, and they part, both having nourished a part of the other's soul that was starving.",
    "**The Blue Hour Architect**\nElara, a historian restoring a faded Art Deco cinema, and Alex, a sound engineer recording the building's unique acoustics before its conversion into condos, are forced into close quarters in the dusty, velvet-lined theater. Their shared obsession with preserving ephemeral beauty leads to a tender, physical connection amidst the relics of a forgotten glamour, their bodies meeting in the projector room as ghostly light plays on the screen. The narrative is framed by Elara’s audio diary, recorded on Alex's equipment. They develop a ritual of watching the \"blue hour\" from the roof, the light transforming the city. In the end, they acknowledge that their love was like the cinema itself: breathtakingly beautiful, structurally unsound, and always destined to be a memory.",
    "**A Composition in Departures**\nIsabelle, a cellist preparing for a prestigious orchestra audition, and Julian, a travel writer between assignments, meet in a Reykjavik hostel during a relentless rainstorm. He is running from commitment; she is shackled to her discipline. Their days are spent exploring geothermal pools and black sand beaches, their nights in a cocoon of intense physical and emotional intimacy, a temporary refuge from their respective pressures. Their ritual is composing a silly, shared \"soundtrack\" for their trip. The story is told through Julian's subsequent travel essay about her, published anonymously. When his next assignment calls, they part at the same bus stop where they met, the rain returned, understanding that some people are meant to be beautiful, short chapters in a longer story.",
    "**The Annotated Margin**\nArthur, a rare book dealer in Edinburgh, and Sophie, a PhD candidate researching scribal annotations, bond over a 17th-century diary filled with cryptic marginalia in two different hands. As they spend weeks together in the library's hushed reading room, piecing together the historical love story within the notes, their own story unfolds in parallel—shared jokes in the margins of her notepad, hands brushing over vellum. Their intimacy is in the quiet confessions and the act of collaborative discovery. They finally decode the diary: the original lovers were also star-crossed. On the day Sophie submits her thesis, they acknowledge their own story is complete. They part not as lovers, but as two people who helped each other solve a beautiful, centuries-old puzzle, leaving their own perfect, unfinished annotation."
