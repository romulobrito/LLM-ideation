  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or personal challenges, with occupations that suggest a degree of sophistication or ambition (e.g., professionals, creatives).\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as urban environments or culturally rich locations, which contribute to the mood and are integral to the story's emotional landscape.\n- Plots revolve around internal conflicts and the tension between desire and duty, with a structure that includes a build-up of intimacy followed by a poignant separation or realization.\n- Emotional arcs are characterized by a tone of bittersweet nostalgia, focusing on themes of connection, missed opportunities, and the acceptance of impermanence.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and emotion, with dialogue that is often introspective and reveals deeper truths about the characters' inner lives.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE overly intellectual or professional conflicts (e.g., zoning debates, archival methods) WITH personal, internal struggles rooted in character flaws and vulnerabilities, such as fear of commitment or past traumas\n- KEEP: bittersweet endings where characters part ways without resentment, honoring the directive\n- ADD: visceral, physical intimacy details (e.g., specific touches, gestures, or sensory moments) to convey yearning and connection\n- REPLACE separation driven primarily by external factors (e.g., visas, job offers, ethical boundaries) WITH separation arising from mutual, character-driven decisions and internal doubts\n- ADD: a reflective narrative voice that explicitly comments on the theme of impermanent love, framing the story\n- REPLACE high-concept metaphors (e.g., 'blueprint,' 'ephemeral art') as central plot devices WITH metaphors woven organically through settings and character interactions, like music or seasonal rituals\n- KEEP: specific occupations and backstories that enrich character identity and conflict",

    "**The Last Reservation**\nElara, a sommelier rebuilding her life after a divorce, and Leo, a chef haunted by his family's failed restaurant, meet during a week-long pop-up dinner series. Their connection is immediate, forged over late-night wine and the intimate language of food. They share visceral moments: his hand guiding hers as they zest a lemon, the taste of sea salt and olive oil on a shared spoon. But Elara’s fear is a cage, and Leo’s dream is a anchor; he is leaving to revive his legacy in another city, and she cannot bear to be another person who abandons her own life. On the final night, they share a kiss that tastes of goodbye, a mutual, unspoken release. The story is framed by Elara, years later, toasting with a glass of the wine they drank, honoring the perfect, impermanent vintage of what they were.",
    "**The Cracks in the Fugue**\nArthur, a meticulous archivist, and Clara, a restorer of stained glass, meet in the echoing silence of a cathedral undergoing repair. He is drawn to her fearlessness as she climbs scaffolds, her hands gently tracing broken lead lines. She is drawn to his quiet intensity as he deciphers centuries-old musical manuscripts. Their intimacy grows in stolen moments: the warmth of her palm on his cold wrist, the shared dust motes dancing in a beam of light she has just repaired. But Arthur’s life is a carefully composed score, a reaction to childhood chaos, and Clara’s is a series of beautiful, temporary interventions. They realize their love is like the music he studies—a sublime, fleeting harmony. They part not with drama, but with a soft, final duet of understanding, leaving the cathedral holding the ghost of their connection in its vaulted space.",
    "**The Season of Almost**\nIsabelle, a landscape architect designing a transient \"pop-up\" park, and Ben, a historian documenting the lost green spaces of the city, collide over a shared bench. He admires the ambition of her work; she is intrigued by his knowledge of what was. Their affair is a single, perfect season. They make love in her studio amid sketches and soil samples, the scent of damp earth and their sweat mingling in the air. He traces the freckles on her shoulders like a constellation. But Isabelle is defined by impermanence, building beauty meant to be dismantled, while Ben is devoted to preservation, to fighting loss. The park’s scheduled demolition becomes the metaphor for their end. They walk through the dying garden one last time, holding hands, acknowledging that some loves are annuals, not perennials, beautiful because they cannot last.",
    "**The Key of G**\nMaya, a former piano prodigy crippled by stage fright, now tunes instruments. She meets Julian, a writer with a stalled novel, when she is hired to tune the grand piano in his sparse apartment. The act of tuning—the delicate, precise turning of pegs, the listening for true resonance—becomes their courtship. He reads her paragraphs; she plays him single, perfect chords. The physical connection is in the space between them: her head leaning against the piano as it vibrates with a note he has struck, the brush of his fingers against hers when he passes her a cup of tea. But Julian’s vulnerability on the page frightens him, and Maya sees her own reflected anxiety in his eyes. They part before the tune can sour, a quiet, preemptive goodbye. The story is told by Maya, who still hears the ghost of his piano, perfectly in tune, in her quietest moments.",
    "**A Catalogue of Small Ships**\nSofia, a literary translator, and Alex, a ship’s pilot, have a transatlantic relationship built during his brief, 48-hour shore leaves. Their time is a collection of intense, sensory fragments: the smell of salt on his wool coat, the taste of espresso at 4 a.m. in a diner, the feel of his stubble against her neck. She lives for the punctuation of his arrivals; he lives for the sanctuary of her apartment. But the very rhythm that defines them—the frantic build-up and the inevitable departure—becomes the source of their undoing. The longing becomes a chasm. During a walk on a foggy pier, they admit that they love the *idea* of each other, the beautiful, aching narrative, more than the unsustainable reality. Their final kiss is a soft, grateful seal on a story that was only ever meant to be a short, perfect chapter."
