  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or personal challenges, and they typically hold professional or creative occupations that influence their perspectives and interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as urban locales or intimate venues, which serve as a backdrop that enhances the characters' emotional experiences and connections.\n- Plots revolve around nuanced, internal conflicts related to commitment, fear of vulnerability, or life choices, often culminating in a poignant, unresolved ending rather than a traditional resolution.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, maintaining a tone that is reflective and introspective, often leaving characters and readers with a sense of what could have been.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and atmosphere, with dialogue that is often understated, revealing deeper truths through subtext and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE archetypal characters with minimal backstories WITH named characters who have specific occupations and detailed personal histories\n- REPLACE high-concept or gimmicky premises centered on objects or chance WITH grounded, character-driven scenarios with emotional depth and realistic conflicts\n- REPLACE poetic but simplistic endings with immediate resolution WITH nuanced endings with unresolved emotional tension and internal conflict\n- KEEP: bittersweet endings that avoid forced resolution, honoring the directive of no happily ever after\n- ADD: specific rituals and shared moments that build intimacy over time\n- ADD: internal character introspection and fears explored through narrative depth\n- ADD: meaningful dialogue that reveals character depth and connection",

    "**The Ferry Architect**\nLeo, a widowed architect restoring an old ferry terminal, meets Clara, a marine biologist studying urban water quality. Their connection forms during daily 5 PM coffees watching the commuter ferries cross. Leo sees his late wife in Clara's laugh; Clara recognizes his grief but stays for the quiet understanding they share. They talk about the structures we build—both concrete and emotional. When Clara receives a grant to continue her research abroad, they don't debate it. On her last day, they share one final coffee, their hands almost touching on the damp railing. He stays with the ghosts of the terminal; she goes to the open water, both carrying the blueprint of a connection that was perfectly designed, but never built.",
    "**The Last Set at The Velvet Note**\nElara, a former pianist working as a music teacher, frequents a jazz club where Ben, a lyricist grappling with writer's block, holds a weekly residency. They bond over a shared love for a obscure composer, their conversations a delicate call-and-response of regret and hope. Elara begins to join him for the last set, weaving melodies around his words. For a few weeks, they create something beautiful and transient. When Ben is offered a permanent gig in another city, he asks her to come. Elara, tied to the city by custody arrangements for her son, declines. Their final duet is a heartbreaking, unrehearsed piece about goodbyes they never put into words.",
    "**The Ghosts We Bake Away**\nArthur, a historian writing a book on his small town, and Maeve, a baker who inherited her grandmother's struggling shop, find solace in each other during the quiet, early morning hours. He sits at her counter, researching; she brings him pastries and stories that aren't in his archives. They are two people anchored by the past—his in books, hers in recipes. Their intimacy is in the shared silence and the warmth of the oven. When Arthur finishes his manuscript, the reality of his return to the city crashes in. They share one last dawn, a sugar-dusted knuckle brushing a tear from a cheek, knowing some histories are meant to be cherished, not continued.",
    "**The Cartographer of Lost Places**\nSasha, a travel photographer trapped by agoraphobia after a traumatic incident, connects with Elias, a cartographer who draws maps of imaginary cities. They meet in an online forum for those who love places they cannot go. Their friendship deepens over shared sketches and photos, a digital intimacy built on yearning. He helps her visualize stepping outside; she gives his maps a soul. After a year, he plans to visit. The day before his flight, Sasha panics and calls it off. They never speak again, but Elias’s final map, mailed to her, is titled \"Sasha's City,\" a perfect, intricate metropolis he could only imagine because of her.",
    "**The Season at the Greenhouse**\nIsla, a botanist specializing in rare orchids, takes a temporary residency at a university greenhouse. She clashes with the head gardener, Henry, a man whose practical, nurturing nature is a quiet rebellion against his failed artistic dreams. Their arguments over soil pH and light exposure slowly transform into a deep, respectful partnership. They spend the season reviving a forgotten orchid, their success a testament to their combined care. When her residency ends, Henry doesn’t ask her to stay, and Isla doesn’t suggest it. They simply tend to the orchid one last time, the air thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the unspoken understanding that some things are only meant for a season."
