  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or life changes, such as divorce, career shifts, or personal losses, which influence their current interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as cultural events, intimate gatherings, or unique locales, which enhance the emotional tone and serve as a backdrop for character development.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, often involving unfulfilled desires or missed opportunities, with a focus on realistic, non-traditional resolutions rather than happy endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, often concluding with a sense of acceptance or unresolved tension.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and setting, with dialogue that reveals character depth and subtext through subtlety and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE generic settings like 'dimly lit Parisian café' or 'coastal Maine town' WITH specific, textured settings like 'restored Ansley Park home' or 'creaky neighborhood bookstore' with sensory details\n- ADD: physical intimacy details that reveal character (e.g., 'his hands in her hair, her teeth at his shoulder') to replace vague touches like 'brush of fingers'\n- KEEP: bittersweet endings where characters consciously choose separation (e.g., 'no vows, only exchanged pages')\n- REPLACE explicit job titles as sole character definition (e.g., 'sommelier', 'tech entrepreneur') WITH occupations woven into behavior (e.g., 'PR partner smuggling almond cake into meetings', 'clerk-writer leaving margin notes')\n- ADD: time-constrained relationships with clear expiration dates (e.g., 'year at Georgetown', 'four winters') instead of open-ended separations\n- REPLACE symbolic objects as primary connection (e.g., cherry pit, postcard) WITH objects that emerge organically from shared history (e.g., 'vinyl shattering against walls', 'beanies stolen')\n- KEEP: intellectual/creative synergy between characters (e.g., 'Calvino debates', 'marginalia arguments')",

    "**\"The Last Night at The Blue Lantern\"**  \nIn a creaky neighborhood bookstore that moonlights as a jazz bar on Fridays, a divorced linguistics professor and a touring musician cross paths over a dog-eared copy of *If on a winter’s night a traveler*. They bond over Calvino debates and the way she traces Hebrew vowels in the margins of his sheet music. Their connection is immediate but tethered to an expiration date: his tour ends in three days. On his last night, they slow-dance between shelves to a crackling Billie Holiday record, her forehead against his collarbone, his hands memorizing the slope of her spine. When dawn comes, they exchange no numbers—only the book, inscribed with a single line: *“You were the right reader.”* The store closes six months later; she hears the news from a passing stranger.",
    "**\"Four Winters in Georgetown\"**  \nA PR executive (who smuggles almond cake into board meetings) and a climate journalist (who annotates reports with haiku) collide during a snowstorm at a restored Ansley Park brownstone’s annual solstice party. They agree to a pact: one night together every winter, no questions asked. Over four years, their encounters are marked by stolen beanies, vinyl records shattered during arguments about Kafka, and the way he always warms her feet between his calves. In year five, she doesn’t show; he finds her name in a byline about melting permafrost. The article’s margin holds her final note: *“Some things can’t be seasonal.”*",
    "**\"Margin of Error\"**  \nTwo rival clerks at an archival library—she’s a former ballet dancer with a limp, he’s a ex-theology student turned atheist—spend years leaving snarky marginalia in each other’s repair logs. Their feud crescendos when they’re assigned to restore a 14th-century manuscript together, their fingers brushing over vellum as they debate divine justice. One night, drunk on cheap wine, they kiss by the photocopier, her teeth catching his lower lip, his hands gripping her hips like they’re the last stable thing. Come morning, she accepts a job in Lisbon; he doesn’t ask her to stay. The manuscript’s final page bears their combined scribble: *“This was never about the text.”*",
    "**\"The Probability of Missing You\"**  \nAt a dying observatory in New Mexico, a washed-up astrophysicist (who wears her late husband’s flannels) and a nomadic poet (who collects roadside motel keys) calculate the odds of a comet’s return. Their collaboration turns intimate: her chalk-dusted fingerprints on his ribs, his mouth mapping the freckles on her shoulders like constellations. When funding is cut, he hitchhikes east, leaving behind a single key labeled *“Room 22—always a view.”* She later learns the motel burned down in ’09. That night, she throws the key into the desert, whispering the equation for escape velocity.",
    "**\"Holding Pattern\"**  \nA flight attendant with a fear of landing and a air traffic controller who stutters in person forge a connection during layovers in a dated Miami airport hotel. Their ritual: sharing stolen mini-bar chocolates and rewriting the endings of noir films, her toes hooked under his thigh, his thumb tracing the scar on her knee from a childhood crash. When she’s transferred to international routes, they meet one last time in Terminal B. He hands her a napkin with a new ending: *“She never looks back. He never stops watching.”* The pen bleeds through the paper, a ink-stain like a holding pattern dissolving."
