  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or life changes, such as divorce, career shifts, or personal losses, which influence their current interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as cultural events, intimate gatherings, or unique locales, which enhance the emotional tone and serve as a backdrop for character development.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, often involving unfulfilled desires or missed opportunities, with a focus on realistic, non-traditional resolutions rather than happy endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, often concluding with a sense of acceptance or unresolved tension.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and setting, with dialogue that reveals character depth and subtext through subtlety and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE archetypal unnamed characters WITH named characters with detailed backstories (e.g., occupations, personal histories, defining traits)\n- REPLACE gimmicky concepts centered on objects WITH character-driven stories focused on emotional depth and complex relationships\n- ADD: Specific sensory details that ground the story (e.g., tastes, smells, sounds, textures)\n- ADD: Nuanced dialogue that reveals character motivations and unspoken tensions\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings without forced resolution or artificial closure\n- KEEP: Rituals or recurring moments that deepen the characters' connection over time\n- REPLACE vague settings WITH specific, evocative locations that enhance mood and theme",

    "**The Last Night at Café Lumière**  \nElena, a divorced pianist playing nightly at a Parisian café, and Tomas, a widowed journalist on assignment, share quiet conversations over bitter espresso and the hum of rain against the windows. They bond over their love of Chopin and the ache of lost spouses, but Tomas’s work visa expires in a week. Their connection deepens through shared silences and the way Elena’s fingers linger on the piano keys when he watches. On his last night, they walk along the Seine, shoulders brushing, but neither speaks of staying or leaving. The next morning, Elena finds an unsigned note tucked into the piano bench: *“Thank you for the music.”* She plays his favorite nocturne one last time, the notes dissolving into the café’s empty air.",
    "**The Bookstore on Winter Street**  \nMira, a reclusive librarian recovering from a career-ending injury, and Leo, a chef who quit his Michelin-starred job after a burnout, meet every Thursday at a tiny bookstore. They trade recommendations—Mira loves Russian tragedies, Leo prefers cookbooks with handwritten notes in the margins. Over spiced chai and the scent of old paper, they confess their fears: Mira’s hands still shake when she shelves books, Leo can’t stand the smell of garlic anymore. When Leo gets an offer to reopen his restaurant abroad, they share a hesitant goodbye hug, his apron flour-dusted, her sweater smelling of ink. Years later, Mira finds a cookbook with a familiar scrawl in the margin: *“Wish you’d tasted this.”*",
    "**Dancing at the Edge of the World**  \nAt a remote Icelandic music festival, Nia, a geologist studying volcanic rock, and Rafn, a folk musician nursing a broken engagement, collide during a midnight sun concert. They spend three days wandering lava fields, sharing stories of failed love—Nia’s ex couldn’t handle her constant travel, Rafn’s fiancée left him for someone “more stable.” On the last night, they dance to a haunting fiddle melody, the wind pulling them closer until their foreheads touch. But Nia’s research expedition leaves at dawn, and Rafn’s tour starts next week. They exchange no numbers, only a single Polaroid: Nia’s bootprints in the ash, Rafn’s shadow stretching toward them.",
    "**The Ferryman’s Daughter**  \nEvery summer, Clara returns to her family’s coastal inn to help her mother, still grieving Clara’s father’s death. This year, she meets Elias, a marine biologist studying endangered seals, who rents a room for the season. They fall into a rhythm: mornings sharing coffee on the dock, evenings debating whether to save the dying lighthouse (Clara’s choice) or let it collapse (Elias’s pragmatism). When Clara confesses she’s selling the inn to pay her mother’s medical bills, Elias offers to buy it—but she refuses, knowing he’d resent the anchor. On his last day, they release one of his rehabbed seals together. Clara watches the boat shrink into the horizon, salt spray stinging her eyes.",
    "**The Clockmaker’s Apprentice**  \nIn a rain-soaked London alley, Felix, a former lawyer turned clockmaker, teaches Noor, a Syrian refugee and engineering student, how to repair antique timepieces. They bond over shared loneliness—Felix’s divorce left him with only his shop, Noor’s family is still overseas—and the precision of gears fitting perfectly into place. When Noor wins a scholarship to MIT, Felix gifts her a pocket watch he’s spent months restoring. Inside, she finds an inscription: *“Time is all we have. Don’t waste it.”* At the airport, Felix hugs her tightly, his shirt smelling of oil and bergamot. Years later, Noor mails him a photo of her first clock design, but he never writes back."
