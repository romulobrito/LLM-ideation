  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or life changes, such as divorce, career shifts, or personal losses, which influence their current interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as cultural events, intimate gatherings, or unique locales, which enhance the emotional tone and serve as a backdrop for character development.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, often involving unfulfilled desires or missed opportunities, with a focus on realistic, non-traditional resolutions rather than happy endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, often concluding with a sense of acceptance or unresolved tension.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and setting, with dialogue that reveals character depth and subtext through subtlety and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE archetypal unnamed characters (e.g., 'the ferryman', 'the archivist') WITH named characters who have detailed backstories and specific occupations\n- REPLACE gimmicky symbolic objects as plot drivers (e.g., ferry tokens, pressed seaweed) WITH organic emotional catalysts rooted in real-world conflicts (e.g., career choices, family dynamics)\n- ADD: Specific geographic and cultural textures to settings (e.g., architecture, local cuisine, academic or professional environments)\n- ADD: Moments of physical intimacy that reveal emotional depth through sensory details (e.g., touch, taste, body language)\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings where characters consciously choose separation for believable reasons\n- KEEP: Professions that mirror the characters' inner conflicts or emotional barriers\n- REPLACE single-encounter hinge moments (e.g., parking lot kiss) WITH extended relationship arcs featuring layered goodbyes or recurring rituals",

    "**The Last Night at Café Lumière**  \nLena, a French expat and sommelier, and Raj, a disillusioned tech entrepreneur, meet weekly at a dimly lit Parisian café to share wine and stories. Both are recovering from failed marriages—Lena’s husband left her for a younger woman, Raj’s wife couldn’t reconcile with his workaholism. Over months, their connection deepens through whispered confessions and the brush of fingers over shared cheese plates. But when Raj is offered a life-changing job in Singapore, they face a choice: disrupt their fragile healing for an uncertain future or part ways. On his last night, they share a bottle of Burgundy, their lips lingering a second too long, before Lena walks away, leaving her favorite corkscrew on the table—a silent goodbye.",
    "**The Archivist’s Daughter**  \nClara, a reserved archivist in Boston, and Mateo, a charismatic documentary filmmaker, bond over her father’s unpublished journals about postwar Italy. Clara’s grief over her father’s death and Mateo’s guilt over exploiting others’ stories for his art create a push-pull dynamic. Their intimacy peaks during a rainstorm in the archives, where Mateo traces the scars on Clara’s hands from paper cuts, but she recoils when he asks to adapt the journals. The night before his flight to Rome, they argue in a neon-lit diner; Clara accuses him of sentimentalizing pain. He leaves the journals on her doorstep with a note: “Some things should stay yours.”",
    "**The Fisherman’s Knot**  \nIn a coastal Maine town, Naomi, a marine biologist studying dying coral reefs, and Eli, a divorced lobsterman, find solace in predawn boat rides. Their attraction grows through shared silence and the salt-sting of the ocean, but Naomi’s grant requires her to relocate to Australia, and Eli can’t abandon his family’s generational trade. Before she leaves, they tie a fisherman’s knot together—a symbol of temporary holds—and Eli presses his forehead to hers, breathing in the scent of her sunscreen. Years later, Naomi sends him a postcard of the Great Barrier Reef, now bleached, with no return address.",
    "**The Sublet**  \nWhen Sofia, a guarded dance instructor, sublets her Brooklyn apartment to Daniel, a touring musician, they communicate only through sticky notes—until a heatwave forces them to share the space. Daniel’s music fills Sofia’s rigid routines with chaos, and her disciplined grace grounds his instability. But Sofia is still raw from her ex’s betrayal, and Daniel’s tour schedule is relentless. On his last day, they slow-dance to a song he wrote for her, their sweat-slicked palms clinging, before Sofia steps back and hands him his guitar case. “Play it somewhere beautiful,” she says, shutting the door softly.",
    "**The Cherry Orchard**  \nIn rural Oregon, Anya, a Ukrainian immigrant running her late husband’s cherry farm, and Tomas, a seasonal worker running from his family’s political scandals in Poland, find kinship in their shared language and the ache of displacement. Their romance blossoms during the harvest, with stolen kisses under blossom-heavy branches, but Tomas’s visa expires, and Anya refuses to leave the land that holds her husband’s memory. At the bus station, Tomas slips a cherry pit into her palm—a seed that won’t grow in her climate. She clasps it tightly as his bus pulls away, the dust settling between them."
