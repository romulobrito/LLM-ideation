  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or life changes, such as divorce, career shifts, or personal losses, which influence their current interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as cultural events, intimate gatherings, or unique locales, which enhance the emotional tone and serve as a backdrop for character development.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, often involving unfulfilled desires or missed opportunities, with a focus on realistic, non-traditional resolutions rather than happy endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, often concluding with a sense of acceptance or unresolved tension.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and setting, with dialogue that reveals character depth and subtext through subtlety and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE Generic settings like diners and cafés WITH Specific, textured locations (e.g., Ansley Park home, Modest Mouse concert, creaky bookstore)\n- REPLACE Characters defined primarily by grief or loss WITH Characters with layered conflicts (e.g., career vs. love, duty vs. desire, intensity vs. durability)\n- ADD: Physical intimacy details that reveal emotional depth (e.g., 'his hands in her hair, her teeth at his shoulder')\n- ADD: Cultural or professional specificity (e.g., healthcare-tech CFO, architecture student, PR partner)\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings where characters consciously choose separation\n- REPLACE Objects as heavy-handed metaphors (chess pawns, pressed flowers) WITH Objects with organic narrative significance (e.g., vinyl records, margin notes, almond cake)\n- ADD: Temporal depth (e.g., 'four winters', 'a year later') to show relationship evolution\n- KEEP: Dialogue that implies more than it states (e.g., 'We were almost something once')",

    "**\"The Last Set at The Blue Lantern\"**  \nJazz pianist Elias and music journalist Nina meet backstage after his final performance at a soon-to-close iconic club. They’d shared a near-romance years ago when she profiled him, but his touring and her divorce derailed it. Tonight, over whiskey and the hum of dismantled equipment, they dissect the album he never recorded—the one inspired by her. Nina’s fingers trace the cigarette burns on his piano bench; Elias confesses he almost called her last winter. The club owner interrupts, offering Elias a residency overseas. Nina smiles, presses her lips to his stubble, and says, \"Send me a postcard.\" The story ends with her watching him from the sidewalk, his shadow moving behind the frosted glass of the club’s door.",
    "**\"Margin Notes\"**  \nAt a Parisian rare books fair, architect Léa discovers her late mentor’s annotated copy of *The Poetics of Space*—with handwritten responses from a conservator named Daniel. She tracks him down in Lisbon, where he’s restoring a monastery. Their connection is immediate, charged with intellectual sparring and stolen touches in dim archives. But Léa’s firm demands her return to Montreal, and Daniel refuses to leave his crumbling father. On her last night, they replicate a marginalia debate in real time, scribbling arguments on hotel stationery. He kisses her palm, ink-smudged, and says, \"We’d have been terrible together.\" She laughs, agreeing, but keeps his notes tucked in her passport.",
    "**\"Four Winters at the Hot Springs\"**  \nEvery February, divorced sommelier Clara and travel writer Marco coincidentally reunite at a Japanese onsen town. Their first year, they shared sake and a hesitant kiss; the second, Marco admitted his fiancée back home. This fourth winter, Clara arrives with news of a vineyard purchase in Chile, while Marco’s finally single. They soak in separate pools this time, steam obscuring their faces. \"You’ll hate the Southern Hemisphere,\" he jokes through the partition. She replies, \"You never visit places twice anyway.\" At dawn, Marco leaves a trail map on her doorstep, circled with a single unfamiliar route—then boards a train without looking back.",
    "**\"The PR Partner’s Almond Cake\"**  \nHealthcare-tech CFO David and crisis PR consultant Val collide during a product-launch disaster in Barcelona. Over 72 sleep-deprived hours, they bond over his failed marriage, her immigrant mother’s bakery, and the almond cake she smuggles into strategy sessions. During a late-night taxi ride, David rests his head on her shoulder; Val doesn’t shrug him off. But when the crisis ends, she declines his offer to join his startup. \"I only fix messes,\" she says, handing him a cake box. A year later, he spots her LinkedIn update—\"Head of Comms, Brussels\"—and texts the photo he took of her laughing in Gaudi’s Park Güell. She doesn’t reply.",
    "**\"Modest Mouse & the Missing Shoe\"**  \nAt a rain-soaked Modest Mouse concert, grad student Avery lends her spare sneaker to Jude, a marine biologist whose boot got sucked into festival mud. They scream lyrics into each other’s ears, swap stories of dead fathers and dissertations, and kiss against a porta-potty. Jude insists on mailing the shoe back; Avery scribbles her address on his wrist. Weeks pass. When the shoe arrives, it’s wrapped in a map of Antarctica—where Jude’s research vessel departs in days. Inside is a note: \"Wish you could’ve broken these in properly.\" Avery wears the mismatched pair to her thesis defense, smiling when her right foot squeaks."
