  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or life changes, such as divorce, career shifts, or personal losses, which influence their current interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as cultural events, intimate gatherings, or unique locales, which enhance the emotional tone and serve as a backdrop for character development.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, often involving unfulfilled desires or missed opportunities, with a focus on realistic, non-traditional resolutions rather than happy endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, often concluding with a sense of acceptance or unresolved tension.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and setting, with dialogue that reveals character depth and subtext through subtlety and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE Generic occupations (e.g., 'journalist', 'chef') WITH Specific, textured professions (e.g., 'healthcare-tech CFO', 'architecture student')\n- ADD: Physical intimacy details that reveal emotional vulnerability (e.g., 'his hands in her hair, her teeth at his shoulder')\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings where characters consciously choose separation\n- REPLACE Broad cultural settings (e.g., Paris, Iceland) WITH Hyper-localized details (e.g., 'Ansley Park home', 'Modest Mouse show')\n- ADD: Explicit articulation of the 'hinge moment' where the relationship's end becomes inevitable\n- REPLACE Symbolic objects as primary connectors (e.g., cookbooks, Polaroids) WITH Shared rituals as emotional anchors (e.g., 'midnight walks, coffee on library steps')\n- KEEP: Characters who recognize their incompatibility without melodrama",

    "**\"The Last Night at The Blue Loon\"**  \nA former marine-turned-jazz pianist and a hospice nurse meet weekly at a decaying mid-century motel bar, bonding over cheap whiskey and the shared ritual of rewriting obituaries for living patrons. Their connection deepens when she confesses she’s drafting one for her estranged father; he plays her a half-finished sonata inspired by her hands, scarred from IV insertions. The hinge moment comes when he’s offered a touring gig and she admits she can’t leave her patients. In the end, they slow-dance to the jukebox’s last song, her forehead against his collarbone, both knowing this is their final night. The bar closes the next month, and she mails his unfinished sheet music to his first tour stop without a return address.",
    "**\"Five Weeks of Rain\"**  \nA forensic botanist analyzing storm drain algae and a disgraced meteorologist-turned-podcaster collide during Atlanta’s record-breaking rainy season, sheltering under the same awning outside a shuttered record store. They develop a ritual: comparing notes on petrichor and sharing umbrella-less walks, her fingers brushing his wrist when lightning strikes. The hinge moment arrives when he’s offered a redemption job in Denver—arid, high-altitude, the antithesis of her waterlogged research. Their last encounter is in her lab, where she identifies a rare lichen in his pocket seam (“from our first walk,” he admits), and he leaves her a voicemail of a desert windstorm. She never saves the number.",
    "**\"The Architecture of Almost\"**  \nA set designer building miniature crime scenes for courtroom trials and a deaf archivist preserving condemned buildings through rubbings of their facades keep crossing paths at a 24-hour diner near the city’s last remaining payphone bank. Their ritual: exchanging found objects—a chipped teacup, a subway token—which he traces onto vellum while she reconstructs their origins. The hinge moment unfolds when she’s commissioned to recreate his childhood home for an upcoming trial; he recognizes the wallpaper pattern and realizes she’s been working from his accidental descriptions. They share one fierce, silent kiss in the diner’s walk-in freezer, breath visible between them, before he moves to Berlin to document postwar ruins.",
    "**\"What We Bury at Rock Shows\"**  \nA noise musician who builds instruments from medical equipment and an embalmer who secretly writes Yelp reviews for funeral homes meet at a Modest Mouse aftershow, bonding over shared tinnitus and a flask of formaldehyde-grade gin. Their ritual: leaving anonymous audio recordings in each other’s coat pockets—field recordings of dialysis clinics, mortuary humming. The hinge moment comes when she’s offered an apprenticeship in Japan (traditional kotsu-age bone cleaning) and he admits his next album samples her voice without permission. They spend her last night dissecting a roadkill possum on his kitchen table, her elbow deep in viscera, his thumb wiping a speck of blood from her cheekbone. She takes the morning flight; he releases the album under a pseudonym.",
    "**\"Holding Patterns\"**  \nA retired air traffic controller with PTSD and a traveling flight attendant specializing in bereavement flights (escorting ashes) keep intersecting at the same airport hotel bar. Their ritual: trading boarding passes with handwritten notes—his in precise aviation shorthand, hers in looping cursive with perfume smudges. The hinge moment occurs when she’s grounded for good after a diagnosis that requires stable treatment, and he’s finally cleared to fly again. Their last meeting is in a terminal chapel, where she presses a Saint Christopher medal into his palm (“for the turbulence”) and he leaves his vintage headset on her suitcase. Years later, he’ll spot her handwriting on a memorial plaque in the airport’s meditation room, but keeps walking to his gate."
