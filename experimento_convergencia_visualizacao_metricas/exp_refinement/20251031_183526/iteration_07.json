  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or life changes, such as divorce, career shifts, or personal losses, which influence their current interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as cultural events, intimate gatherings, or unique locales, which enhance the emotional tone and serve as a backdrop for character development.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, often involving unfulfilled desires or missed opportunities, with a focus on realistic, non-traditional resolutions rather than happy endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, often concluding with a sense of acceptance or unresolved tension.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and setting, with dialogue that reveals character depth and subtext through subtlety and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE archetypal unnamed characters WITH named characters who have detailed backstories and specific occupations\n- REPLACE minimalist settings WITH specific, textured settings that include sensory and cultural details\n- ADD physical intimacy details to replace purely emotional or symbolic connections\n- REPLACE objects as primary symbols WITH shared rituals and routines that define the relationship\n- ADD explicit dialogue about the relationship’s limitations and unspoken boundaries\n- KEEP bittersweet endings without forced resolution or artificial closure\n- REPLACE passive acceptance of separation WITH active, mutual decisions to part ways",

    "**The Last Night at the Jazz Club**  \nElias, a divorced jazz pianist, and Naomi, a travel writer recovering from a career burnout, meet at a dimly lit club in New Orleans. Their connection is immediate—bonding over shared loves: bourbon, Billie Holiday, and the ache of starting over. For months, they meet every Thursday, trading stories and slow-dancing between sets. But Naomi’s visa is expiring, and Elias can’t leave his aging father. On their final night, they share a kiss salty with tears, and Naomi whispers, “This was enough, wasn’t it?” The bittersweet truth hangs between them as she walks into the humid night, leaving Elias to play one last solo.",
    "**The Apartment Above the Bakery**  \nIn a cramped Berlin flat, Laleh, an Iranian immigrant running a bakery, and Tomas, a Chilean expat working nights at a radio station, fall into a routine: sharing warm bread at 4 AM, their fingers brushing over flour-dusted counters. They never speak of the exes they left behind or the futures they can’t promise. When Tomas gets a job in Lisbon, they spend his last week mapping the city together, memorizing its cracks. At the train station, Laleh presses a bag of saffron buns into his hands. “No goodbyes,” she says. They both know some loves are meant to be seasonal.",
    "**The Ferry to Alcatraz**  \nMarina, a historian researching prison letters, and Jake, a former firefighter turned tour guide, meet on the foggy ferry to Alcatraz. Their chemistry is undeniable—joking about ghost stories, shoulders touching as the boat rocks. But Jake is grieving his late wife, and Marina is leaving for a fellowship in Vienna. They spend one golden afternoon tracing inmate graffiti, Jake’s calloused fingers lingering on Marina’s wrist. “You’ll forget me,” he teases. Marina shakes her head. “I’ll remember you exactly like this.” The ferry back is silent, the bay swallowing their unspoken words.",
    "**The Rooftop Garden**  \nIn Mumbai’s monsoon season, Rohan, a widowed botanist, and Aanya, a chef recovering from a failed restaurant, tend to a rooftop garden. They trade cuttings of herbs and stories of loss, their hands dirty with soil and hope. When Aanya gets a chance to reopen her restaurant abroad, they cook one last meal together—garlic and grief mingling in the air. “You’ll hate the winters there,” Rohan says, tugging at a basil leaf. Aanya laughs wetly. “I’ll hate leaving more.” The rain begins as they split the last samosa, their goodbye as tender as new growth.",
    "**The Midnight Bookstore**  \nEvery Friday, Sofia, a nurse with insomnia, and Daniel, a novelist with writer’s block, meet at a 24-hour bookstore in Buenos Aires. They read aloud to each other in the philosophy aisle, Daniel’s voice rough from cigarettes, Sofia’s fingers tracing his marginalia. When Sofia admits she’s taking a job in Patagonia, Daniel writes her a letter instead of arguing. “It’s your turn to live a story,” it says. She tucks it into his favorite book, knowing he’ll find it later. The bell jingles as she leaves, the scent of old paper clinging to her coat."
