  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or life changes, such as divorce, career shifts, or personal losses, which influence their current interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as cultural events, intimate gatherings, or unique locales, which enhance the emotional tone and serve as a backdrop for character development.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, often involving unfulfilled desires or missed opportunities, with a focus on realistic, non-traditional resolutions rather than happy endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, often concluding with a sense of acceptance or unresolved tension.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and setting, with dialogue that reveals character depth and subtext through subtlety and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE generic settings like 'dimly lit club' or 'cramped Berlin flat' WITH specific, textured locations like 'restored Ansley Park home' or 'creaky neighborhood bookstore' with sensory details\n- ADD: moments of physical intimacy that reveal character (e.g., 'his hands in her hair, her teeth at his shoulder') to deepen emotional stakes\n- KEEP: bittersweet endings where characters consciously choose separation (e.g., 'no goodbyes')\n- REPLACE broad-stroke professions like 'travel writer' or 'novelist' WITH hyper-specific roles like 'forensic botanist analyzing storm drain algae' or 'deaf archivist preserving condemned buildings through rubbings'\n- ADD: shared rituals with symbolic weight (e.g., 'exchanged pages and a long hold under city lights')\n- REPLACE explicit dialogue about feelings (e.g., 'This was enough, wasn’t it?')

    "**\"The Last Night at the Blue Heron\"**  \nIn a creaky, salt-stained beachside bar in Maine, a forensic botanist studying invasive seaweed species meets a former marine biologist turned whiskey distiller. They bond over shared grief—her failed marriage, his brother’s drowning—while tracing water rings on the bar with their fingertips. Their ritual: exchanging pressed seaweed specimens and handwritten notes about lost things. One night, she finds him etching coordinates into the bar’s wood—the site of his brother’s accident—and presses her palm over it until his breathing steadies. They kiss in the parking lot, her lips tasting of brine, his hands gripping her waist like a lifeline. By dawn, she leaves a specimen jar with a single note: *“Some tides don’t come back.”* He never opens it.",
    "**\"The Archivists’ Waltz\"**  \nA deaf archivist preserving condemned theaters through rubbings of their ornate walls collides with a touring pianist who plays the same Chopin piece nightly, obsessively, as penance for a career-ending injury. They meet in the balcony of a 1920s cinema slated for demolition, where she traces the velvet grooves of seats while he mouths the vibrations of her pencil strokes. Their language: trading sheet music with silent annotations. One evening, he presses her hand to his throat as he hums; she feels the fracture in his voice. They part when the wrecking ball arrives, leaving behind a shared folder of rubbings and scores, labeled *“Unfinished in the Key of Demolition.”*",
    "**\"The Ferryman’s Coin\"**  \nAt a fog-drenched ferry terminal in Seattle, a divorced tugboat captain and a hospice nurse tending to her dying father cross paths weekly. He gifts her rusted bolts from his boat; she leaves him dried flowers from patients’ rooms. Their intimacy peaks when she stitches a cut on his knuckles, her breath hitching as he curls his fingers around hers. Later, she finds a bolt on her father’s nightstand—his final “gift” to her. At the terminal, the captain presses a ferry token into her palm: *“For the crossing I can’t make with you.”* She boards without looking back.",
    "**\"The Clockmaker’s Apprentice\"**  \nIn a Viennese antique shop specializing in broken timepieces, a clockmaker’s apprentice (a former prodigy violinist with nerve damage) and a war photographer with tinnitus share silent afternoons. He adjusts her grandfather’s pocket watch; she photographs his trembling hands. Their pact: winding every clock at 3 PM, the hour her concert career ended and his left ear went silent. When she leaves for Kyiv, he slips a stopped watch into her coat—set to 3:00—with a note: *“For the time we didn’t have.”* She never sends the developed film of his face.",
    "**\"The Greenhouse Effect\"**  \nTwo horticulturalists—one breeding drought-resistant roses, the other cataloguing extinct orchids—meet at a derelict Georgia greenhouse. She tends to resilience; he mourns loss. Their ritual: grafting his orchids onto her rose roots, creating hybrids that bloom once, then wither. One stormy evening, they shelter among the plants, her head on his chest, listening to rain patter on glass. He whispers, *“We’re just another failed experiment,”* and she doesn’t correct him. At dawn, she takes a cutting; he burns the rest. Years later, her garden flourishes with roses that smell faintly of orchids. She never plants them together again."
