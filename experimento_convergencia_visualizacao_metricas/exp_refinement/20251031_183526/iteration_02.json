  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or life changes, such as divorce, career shifts, or personal losses, which influence their current interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as cultural events, intimate gatherings, or unique locales, which enhance the emotional tone and serve as a backdrop for character development.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, often involving unfulfilled desires or missed opportunities, with a focus on realistic, non-traditional resolutions rather than happy endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, often concluding with a sense of acceptance or unresolved tension.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and setting, with dialogue that reveals character depth and subtext through subtlety and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE archetypal unnamed characters WITH named characters with detailed backstories.\n- REPLACE minimal physical or emotional intimacy WITH specific tactile details that convey intimacy.\n- ADD explicit acknowledgment of the 'no happily ever after' directive within the narration.\n- KEEP bittersweet endings without forced resolution.\n- ADD shared rituals or traditions that deepen the characters' connection.\n- REPLACE single-meeting scenarios WITH multi-scene relationships that unfold over time.\n- ADD characters with conflicting obligations that create tension in their relationship.",

    "**\"The Last Night at the Jazz Club\"**  \nElena, a divorced pianist, and Marcus, a widowed bartender, share a quiet connection over late-night drinks after her sets at a fading jazz club. Their ritual—whiskey neat for him, chamomile tea for her—becomes a sanctuary. Marcus traces the rim of his glass with his thumb, remembering how his wife used to hum along to Elena’s playing. Elena notices but never asks. When the club closes for good, they linger outside, shoulders brushing. “We could find another place,” Marcus offers, but Elena shakes her head; she’s moving to Berlin for a residency. The unspoken truth hangs between them: some connections are meant to be fleeting. They part with a hug, his hands warm against her back, her perfume lingering on his collar long after she’s gone.",
    "**\"The Bookstore on Rue de Seine\"**  \nClaire, an American expat recovering from a bad breakup, and Olivier, a French chef with a failing restaurant, meet weekly at a tiny Parisian bookstore. They bond over dog-eared copies of Camus and the way Claire’s laugh echoes in the cramped aisles. Olivier brings her croissants still warm from his oven; she reads him passages in halting French. When Claire gets a job offer back home, Olivier doesn’t ask her to stay. Instead, he gifts her a first edition of *The Stranger*, inscribed: *For the one who understood*. Years later, Claire finds the book in a thrift store, his handwriting faded but unmistakable. She smiles, presses it to her chest, and puts it back on the shelf.",
    "**\"The Ferry to Alcatraz\"**  \nRafael, a historian leading tours at Alcatraz, and Naomi, a travel writer researching solitary confinement, cross paths on the ferry. Rafael’s voice cracks when he describes the prisoners’ longing for the mainland; Naomi’s pen stills. They spend days walking the island, her fingers brushing his as they trace the graffiti left by inmates. One evening, Naomi confesses she’s leaving soon—her visa’s up, and her sick mother needs her in Tokyo. Rafael nods, hands deep in his pockets. On her last day, he gives her a pebble from the shore: “Something to remember the island by.” She pockets it, knowing she’ll carry it forever, even as they drift apart.",
    "**\"The Lighthouse Keeper’s Daughter\"**  \nTom, a marine biologist studying migratory patterns, rents a room from Maggie, the daughter of a retired lighthouse keeper. They fall into a rhythm: mornings with coffee on the porch, evenings charting stars. Maggie teaches him the names of local birds; he mends her father’s old fishing nets, their fingers tangling in the twine. When Tom’s research funding dries up, he must return to the city. Maggie doesn’t ask him to stay—her father’s dementia anchors her to the coast. On his last night, they share a bottle of whiskey, her head on his shoulder, the lighthouse beam sweeping over them like a silent farewell.",
    "**\"The Flower Market at Dawn\"**  \nLila, a florist grieving her brother’s death, and Amir, a chef mourning his failed marriage, meet at the wholesale flower market every Sunday at 4 a.m. He buys lavender for his bakery; she chooses sunflowers for her shop’s window. Over months, they exchange recipes and grief, their gloved hands brushing as they split bundles of rosemary. When Amir’s ex-wife offers reconciliation, Lila encourages him to try. At their final market visit, he tucks a sprig of forget-me-nots into her apron pocket. “For luck,” he says. She watches him walk away, the flowers trembling in her grip, the dawn light turning everything gold and temporary."
