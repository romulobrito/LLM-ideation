  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or life changes, such as divorce, career shifts, or personal losses, which influence their current interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as cultural events, intimate gatherings, or unique locales, which enhance the emotional tone and serve as a backdrop for character development.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, often involving unfulfilled desires or missed opportunities, with a focus on realistic, non-traditional resolutions rather than happy endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, often concluding with a sense of acceptance or unresolved tension.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and setting, with dialogue that reveals character depth and subtext through subtlety and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE archetypal unnamed professions WITH named characters with specific backstories and social contexts (e.g., occupations, relationship histories)\n- ADD: Textured, mundane-yet-significant rituals (e.g., shared routines or habits) to ground fleeting connections\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings where characters consciously choose separation\n- REPLACE concept-heavy settings WITH everyday spaces charged with emotional weight (e.g., familiar locations with personal significance)\n- ADD: Explicit articulation of the 'hinge moment' to clarify turning points in the relationship\n- KEEP: Sensory details that reveal intimacy (e.g., tactile, taste, or auditory cues)\n- REPLACE metaphor-heavy titles WITH direct yet evocative titles that reflect the story's emotional core",

    "**\"The Last Night at Café Lumière\"**  \nElena, a divorced bookstore owner, and Leo, a touring musician recovering from a career-ending injury, meet every Thursday at a dimly lit café to share silence and chess. Their connection is built on unspoken understanding—Elena’s grief over her failed marriage, Leo’s loss of music—but neither admits their growing affection. The hinge moment comes when Leo is offered a teaching job overseas. On his last night, they play one final game, the chessboard between them a map of all the moves they never made. The café’s hum of espresso machines and clinking cups fades as they part with a handshake, both knowing this is the right, if painful, choice. The story ends with Elena pocketing a lone pawn left behind, a tactile reminder of what almost was.",
    "**\"Halfway to Nowhere\"**  \nMira, a widowed botanist, and James, a former journalist turned truck driver, share a monthly ritual: meeting at a roadside diner halfway between their cities. They trade stories—hers about rare plants, his about life on the road—but never address the loneliness that binds them. The hinge moment arrives when James confesses he’s selling his truck to care for his estranged father. Over soggy pancakes, they acknowledge this is their last meeting. Mira gifts him a pressed flower from her late husband’s garden; James leaves her a mixtape of road songs. The diner’s flickering neon sign casts long shadows as they walk to separate cars, the weight of unspoken love lingering like the scent of diesel and maple syrup.",
    "**\"The Sublet\"**  \nWhen Nora, a burned-out lawyer, sublets her apartment to Rafa, a nomadic artist, they develop a quiet intimacy through Post-it notes left on the fridge. Their backstories collide—Nora’s divorce, Rafa’s rootlessness—but their connection deepens over shared rituals: brewing coffee at 6 a.m., watching the same streetlight flicker at night. The hinge moment comes when Nora’s lease ends, and Rafa must move on. On his last day, they finally share a meal, the air thick with the aroma of garlic and unspoken words. They part with a hug, Nora pocketing a doodle he leaves on a napkin. The story closes with her staring at the empty apartment, the echoes of his laughter replaced by the hum of the refrigerator.",
    "**\"The Archive Assistant\"**  \nClara, a reserved archivist, and Eli, a charismatic historian researching his late wife, spend months side by side in a dusty university library. Their bond grows through shared lunches and deciphering faded letters, but Eli’s grief is a wall Clara won’t breach. The hinge moment arrives when Eli finishes his book and accepts a job abroad. On his last day, they linger in the stacks, the scent of old paper between them. Clara hands him a discovered photo of his wife; he gifts her a first edition she’d admired. As the library lights dim, they exchange a smile that holds everything unsaid. The ending finds Clara reshelving his notes, her fingers brushing the space where he once sat.",
    "**\"The Ferryman\"**  \nEvery winter, Lila, a marine biologist studying coastal erosion, takes the same ferry piloted by Tomas, a widower who speaks little but remembers her coffee order (black, one sugar). Their fleeting exchanges—about weather, seabirds—mask deeper yearnings. The hinge moment comes when Lila accepts a job inland. On her final crossing, Tomas breaks routine to join her on deck, handing her a hand-carved gull. The ferry’s horn drowns her whispered thanks. As she disembarks, the salt wind carries the scent of his wool coat, a sensory imprint of the connection they’ll never explore. The story ends with Tomas watching her figure shrink on the dock, the ferry’s engine thrumming like a heartbeat."
