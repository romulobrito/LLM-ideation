  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or life changes, such as divorce, career shifts, or personal losses, which influence their current interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as cultural events, intimate gatherings, or unique locales, which enhance the emotional tone and serve as a backdrop for character development.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, often involving unfulfilled desires or missed opportunities, with a focus on realistic, non-traditional resolutions rather than happy endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, often concluding with a sense of acceptance or unresolved tension.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and setting, with dialogue that reveals character depth and subtext through subtlety and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE archetypal unnamed characters WITH named characters who have detailed backstories and specific occupations\n- REPLACE gimmicky plot devices WITH emotional depth through shared, mundane experiences\n- ADD specific sensory details (tastes, sounds, textures) to heighten emotional stakes\n- ADD nuanced dialogue that reveals character history and unspoken tensions\n- KEEP bittersweet endings without forced resolution or closure\n- REPLACE vague settings WITH geographically specific locations that anchor the story\n- ADD temporal markers to show the passage of time and the weight of repetition",

    "**The Last Night at Café Lumière**  \nIn a dimly lit Parisian café near Montmartre, Elias, a divorced architect, and Noémie, a jazz pianist recovering from a career-ending injury, meet every Thursday to share espresso and quiet companionship. Their conversations are laced with unspoken attraction, but Elias is still grieving his failed marriage, and Noémie is preparing to leave for a teaching job in Lyon. Over the sound of rain tapping against the windows and the faint hum of a Miles Davis record, they linger over their last evening together, fingers brushing against the chipped porcelain cups. The air smells of burnt sugar and wet wool. When Noémie finally stands to leave, Elias doesn’t ask her to stay. The café’s neon sign flickers as she disappears into the mist, leaving behind only the echo of her laughter and the weight of what might have been.",
    "**The Book of Unfinished Recipes**  \nAt a community cooking class in Portland, Maya, a food blogger recovering from a breakup, and Leo, a widowed sommelier, bond over their shared love of imperfect dishes. Their weekly meetings—chopping herbs, tasting sauces, laughing over burnt soufflés—become a quiet refuge. Leo’s hands still smell of his late wife’s perfume when he handles the spices; Maya’s jokes about her ex are a little too sharp. One evening, as they knead dough under the warm glow of string lights, Leo confesses he’s selling his restaurant to move closer to his daughter. Maya nods, pressing her thumb into the dough too hard. They exchange a hug that lasts a beat too long, and the next week, Leo’s spot at the counter remains empty. The recipe book they started together stays unfinished.",
    "**The Ferryman’s Waltz**  \nOn a foggy morning in Seattle, Clara, a marine biologist studying orca communication, strikes up a conversation with Finn, the ferry operator who wears his father’s old navy peacoat. Their brief exchanges—about the saltiness of the air, the way seagulls cry like lost children—become the highlight of her commute. Finn’s wife died years ago; Clara’s engagement ended when her fiancé refused to leave Boston. One autumn day, as the ferry cuts through the mist, Finn hands Clara a mixtape of ocean sounds and tells her it’s his last shift. She watches him walk away, his boots scuffing the damp deck, and presses the tape to her chest. The next morning, a new ferryman greets her, and the tape player in her lab stays silent.",
    "**The Clockmaker’s Hands**  \nIn a tiny watch repair shop in Prague, Karel, a stoic clockmaker with ink-stained fingers, and Tereza, a travel writer with a broken heirloom pocket watch, spend afternoons debating time’s cruel humor. Karel’s son left for America years ago and never called; Tereza’s nomadic life leaves no room for roots. As he fixes the watch’s delicate gears, she scribbles notes about his precise movements, the way his breath hitches when their hands accidentally touch. The shop smells of oil and old paper. When the watch finally ticks again, Tereza leaves for Morocco, promising to return. Karel waits, polishing the countertop until it gleams, but the doorbell only rings with customers. Years later, the watch appears in a pawnshop window, still keeping perfect time.",
    "**The Florist’s Daughter**  \nIn a flower shop tucked into a Brooklyn brownstone, Rosa, a former dancer with a bad knee, and Daniel, a chef who lost his sense of smell after COVID, trade stories while she arranges bouquets for his restaurant. The scent of lilies clings to her skin; his apron is always dusted with flour. They joke about their ruined careers, but the laughter fades when Daniel admits he’s moving to Austin to open a new place. On his last day, Rosa hands him a single white peony—the flower for “I’ll miss you.” He tucks it behind his ear, and for a moment, she sees the man he might have been. The bell jingles as he leaves, and Rosa turns back to the flowers, her hands trembling just slightly."
