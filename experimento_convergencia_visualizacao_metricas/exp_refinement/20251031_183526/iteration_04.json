  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or life changes, such as divorce, career shifts, or personal losses, which influence their current interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as cultural events, intimate gatherings, or unique locales, which enhance the emotional tone and serve as a backdrop for character development.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, often involving unfulfilled desires or missed opportunities, with a focus on realistic, non-traditional resolutions rather than happy endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, often concluding with a sense of acceptance or unresolved tension.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and setting, with dialogue that reveals character depth and subtext through subtlety and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE Generic occupations (e.g., 'florist', 'chef') WITH Specific, high-stakes professions (e.g., 'healthcare-tech CFO', 'PR partner') with career-driven conflicts\n- ADD: Geographically precise settings (e.g., 'Ansley Park home', 'Modest Mouse show in Atlanta’s Tabernacle') that anchor emotional weight\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings where characters consciously choose separation\n- REPLACE Symbolic objects as primary connectors (e.g., pebbles, matchbooks) WITH Shared rituals (e.g., 'midnight walks, lecture halls') that deepen intimacy\n- ADD: Explicit narrative framing (e.g., 'The narration insists from the start—love’s truest stories don’t promise forever') to underscore thematic intent\n- REPLACE Passive acceptance of circumstances WITH Active, painful choices (e.g., 'They choose one last tender night... and let the words hang—beautiful and useless')\n- KEEP: Sensory details (e.g., 'her teeth at his shoulder', 'the starch of her blouse') to ground emotional moments",

    "**\"The Last Lecture Hall\"**  \nA healthcare-tech CFO and a PR partner meet weekly at Emory University’s Candler Library, bonding over late-night study sessions despite their high-stakes careers. Their ritual—whispered debates over lukewarm coffee—becomes a sanctuary from their chaotic lives. When she’s offered a promotion in Singapore, they spend one final night tracing the spines of borrowed books, fingers brushing too deliberately. The narration insists: *Some loves are footnotes, not chapters.* They part without promises, her starch-blouse shoulder damp under his lips, the scent of ink and regret lingering.",
    "**\"Modest Mouse, Atlanta’s Tabernacle, 2023\"**  \nTwo divorcees collide at a concert, screaming lyrics into the sweat-thick air like exorcisms. He’s a burned-out civil rights attorney; she’s a pediatric surgeon with trembling hands. Between encores, they confess their failures in the smoking area, her teeth grazing his knuckles when she laughs. By dawn, they’re tangled in his Ansley Park guestroom, but she leaves a note: *I can’t be another thing you survive.* The bassline echoes as he folds the paper—too precise, too final.",
    "**\"The CFO’s Midnight Walk\"**  \nEvery Tuesday, a venture capitalist and a climate journalist pass each other on the BeltLine’s Eastside Trail, their strides syncing briefly before diverging. Months of silent recognition crescendo when he stops her during a summer storm. Under his umbrella, she admits she’s moving to Oslo for a fellowship. They share a kiss that tastes of rainwater and *what if*, then step back—*active, painful choices*—her ponytail catching on his watch as she walks away.",
    "**\"The PR Partner’s Empty Chair\"**  \nAt a cramped Decatur wine bar, a grieving widow and a corporate strategist bond over Malbec and mutual avoidance of dating apps. Their ritual: debating the ethics of his latest campaign while her wedding ring gathers dust in her purse. When he confesses feelings, she presses the ring into his palm. *Love isn’t always louder than loss,* the narration sighs. He returns it, and they clink glasses—*beautiful and useless*—one last time.",
    "**\"The Ansley Park Rehearsal Dinner\"**  \nA music publicist and a symphony conductor reconnect at his ex-fiancée’s wedding, their old affair simmering during stolen moments by the pool. The humid air clings like unspoken apologies until she murmurs, *We’d only ruin it again.* They slow-dance to the band’s cover of \"First Day of My Life,\" her heel digging into his instep—*sensory grounding*—before she vanishes into a Lyft, his cufflink clutched in her fist."
