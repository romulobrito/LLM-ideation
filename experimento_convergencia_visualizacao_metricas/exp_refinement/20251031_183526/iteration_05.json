  "bullets": "CORE DIRECTIVES (ALWAYS FOLLOW):\n- Characters often have complex backstories involving past relationships or life changes, such as divorce, career shifts, or personal losses, which influence their current interactions.\n- Settings are often specific and atmospheric, such as cultural events, intimate gatherings, or unique locales, which enhance the emotional tone and serve as a backdrop for character development.\n- Plots revolve around internal and relational conflicts, often involving unfulfilled desires or missed opportunities, with a focus on realistic, non-traditional resolutions rather than happy endings.\n- Emotional arcs emphasize themes of longing, connection, and the bittersweet nature of relationships, often concluding with a sense of acceptance or unresolved tension.\n- Craft elements include the use of sensory details and metaphors to evoke mood and setting, with dialogue that reveals character depth and subtext through subtlety and implication.\n\nCURRENT CORRECTIONS (address recent issues):\n- Center your story around two characters who like each other but don't get a happily ever after.\n- REPLACE archetypal unnamed characters WITH named characters with detailed backstories and occupations\n- ADD: Specific sensory details that ground the story in a tangible world\n- KEEP: Bittersweet endings without forced resolution\n- REPLACE generic settings WITH geographically precise and evocative settings\n- ADD: Rituals or recurring moments that deepen the connection between characters\n- REPLACE abrupt emotional shifts WITH gradual, layered emotional arcs that build tension and intimacy\n- KEEP: Narration that frames the story with a reflective, almost philosophical tone",

    "**The Last Night at Café Lumière**  \nIn a dimly lit Parisian café near Montmartre, Clara, a divorced art historian, and Elias, a jazz pianist recovering from a career-ending hand injury, meet every Thursday to share coffee and silence. Their ritual begins with Clara sketching the café’s patrons while Elias hums melodies he can no longer play. Over months, their unspoken bond deepens—until Clara accepts a job in Lisbon. On her last night, Elias finally plays a halting tune on the café’s out-of-tune piano, his hands trembling. Clara leaves her sketchbook behind, open to a page titled *Elias, Mid-Melody*. The story ends with him tracing the lines of his own face, the café’s bell jingling as the door closes behind her.",
    "**The Ferryman’s Daughter**  \nOn a foggy morning in coastal Maine, Theo, a widowed lighthouse keeper, rows out to meet Mira, the ferryman’s daughter, who delivers his supplies. Their conversations—about storms, lost ships, and Theo’s late wife—are brief but charged. One autumn day, Mira confesses she’s leaving to care for her ailing mother inland. Theo gifts her his wife’s compass, its needle stuck pointing north. Years later, he finds it returned in his mailbox, the needle freed, with no note. The story lingers on the weight of the compass in his palm, the sound of a distant ferry horn, and the understanding that some connections are meant to be temporary.",
    "**The Bookbinder and the Florist**  \nIn a cramped Barcelona alley, Liora, a bookbinder still grieving her brother’s death, trades repairs for bouquets from Mateo, a florist hiding his failing eyesight. Their barter becomes a ritual: she mends his favorite poetry collections; he leaves her flowers pressed between the pages. When Mateo’s vision deteriorates irreparably, he gives Liora his last gift—a rare edition with dried forget-me-nots marking a poem about ephemeral beauty. The story closes with Liora running her fingers over the braille dedication he added, realizing too late what he couldn’t say aloud.",
    "**Five Minutes at the Gare du Nord**  \nEvery winter, Nina, a travel writer, and Julien, a chef returning to his family’s Lyon bistro, cross paths at the Gare du Nord during the same delayed train. They share croissants and stories—Nina’s failed engagement, Julien’s estrangement from his father—always parting with a promise to meet next year. On the fifth year, Nina arrives to find the train on time and Julien absent. A text flashes on her phone: *“Got the early train. Finally talked to him.”* The ending lingers on Nina’s smile as she boards, the flaky crumbs of an uneaten pastry scattering on the platform.",
    "**The Watchmaker’s Apprentice**  \nIn Kyoto, Kei, a watchmaker haunted by his ex-wife’s departure, teaches Aya, a transient horologist, to repair antique timepieces. Their lessons unfold in his tiny shop, filled with the ticking of a hundred clocks. Aya confesses she’s leaving to trace her nomadic father’s footsteps in Hokkaido. On her last day, Kei gifts her a broken pocket watch—his ex-wife’s—hoping she’ll fix it someday. Years later, he receives it in the mail, restored but still ticking unevenly. The final image is Kei holding it to his ear, the irregular beats mirroring his heartbeat."
